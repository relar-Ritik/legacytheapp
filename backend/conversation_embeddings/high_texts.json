  "T:\thi John\nC:\thi Justin I'm dropping off a new prescription\nT:\tno problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that\nC:\tyeah I was in the hospital for about ten days I had this infection where the fluids are oh I need my refills they didn't give me any new prescriptions in the hospital\nT:\tI did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up but if you give me twenty minutes I can get them all ready for you\nC:\tI twisted my ankle leaving the apartment this morning it's hurting real bad\nT:\tthat's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys\nC:\treally but they told me I couldn't take Tylenol but I thought that ibuprofen would be okay at the hospital when I first got there they said my kidneys weren't doing too good but when I left they said everything was back to normal\nT:\twell if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John\nC:\tsure\nT:\tdoes look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does\nC:\tno it's the same\nT:\tI think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees let me grab that for you real quick so this is the instant cold pack so just basically to activate it you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees and the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen and because if your liver condition the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney and your blood pressure medication the lisinopril there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney and the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure and that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation and if you have further questions we can talk to your doctor\nC:\tthanks for letting me know about this I certainly don't want to hurt my kidneys I got enough problems\nT:\tthat's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you\n",

  "T:\tyou Rachel it hurt coming today what brings you in\nC:\twell so I've been working with the weight management clinic and I just when I found out that this was an opportunity I thought why not use this as another resource to help me lose weight\nT:\tand why why do you want to lose weight\nC:\twell so really recently actually my older sister has had a lot of health concerns relate to her weight and it just sort of jostled me a little bit because we're so similar\nT:\treally related to your sister\nC:\tyeah so I've been this weight for a while but like now I feel like this is really the time for me to start making some changes\nT:\twhat kind of problems sister experience\nC:\twell so she has some high cholesterol and high blood pressure and I guess those are things that were running my family but I'm really worried because my grandmother has suffered from a stroke and I definitely don't want to do that\nT:\tthere's big change gears to get healthy\nC:\tyeah I mean another birthday rolled around and I just realized that I'm not getting any younger thank you thank you but yeah so there's some pressure there too\nT:\tso there's been some big things going on your life that's really prompted your push for weight loss so I just want to check it really quick and so on a scale of one to ten with one being really super important and have to do it starting today where are you in turn taken away\nC:\toh I would definitely say a ten\nT:\tokay\nC:\twe want right now for me is really really important\nT:\tand what puts you out of 10\nC:\tjust kind of all these reminders in the last year and then I'm getting a little bit older all of those things together make it a 10\nT:\tokay bad idea on in that same scale with one being not confident at all to 10 being super super confident where would you say your are in terms of your confidence to actually lose the way\nC:\tOh honestly I would probably say that I'm like a five or six with confidence\nT:\tand what what promise you to pick a five or six\nC:\tI just like been tried to lose weight before and those things certainly have failed as I still I'm the same way\nT:\tokay\nC:\tthat's what really only leaves me at five or six\nT:\tokay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence\nC:\tI think I would be more confident if I understood like how do you use some of the gym equipment a little bit more so it's not something that I feel really comfortable doing I just don't I know feel very confident when I'm in there except to use the bike and there are elliptical so some of that could be I would really like to do some strength training but I just don't know how\nT:\tokay that sounds really interesting\n",
  "T:\thi Andrea thanks for coming in\nC:\tthank you\nT:\tso I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself\nC:\tsure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that\nT:\twow you really are involved in music\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhen did you start\nC:\tI started playing about 10 years ago actually\nT:\tWow\nC:\tyeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah\nT:\tvery cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun\nC:\tum you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that\nT:\tit's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family\nC:\tuh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog\nT:\tcute what kind of dogs\nC:\tthe golden retriever\nT:\toh nice\nC:\tI'm a big boy\nT:\tvery fun all right and how are things going in school for you\nC:\tpretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish\nT:\tokay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school\nC:\tI'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something\nT:\tokay you have some pretty big dreams\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life\nC:\tum I think a sense of community and belonging\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI think those two and um respect respect\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three\nC:\tyeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI place great importance in that\nT:\tokay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends\nC:\tum sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out\nT:\tmm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved\nC:\tyeah sometimes\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene\nC:\tuh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say\nT:\tmm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking\nC:\tI'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three\nT:\tmm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink\nC:\tthe days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah\nT:\tso it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get\nC:\tdefinitely\nT:\tokay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games\nC:\tI think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tbut in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have\nT:\tokay so there's sort of pros and cons\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tokay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol\nC:\tum it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad\nT:\tokay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol\nC:\tum a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid\nT:\thmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening\nC:\tsometimes yeah\nT:\tcan you tell me a little bit about that\nC:\twell I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun\nT:\tyeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened\nC:\tfor me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and\nT:\tokay\nC:\tit kind of put it down around my my fun\nT:\thuh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol\nC:\tyeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff\nT:\tso you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tgot it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions\nC:\tI just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun\nT:\tokay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then\nC:\tit sort of defeats the purpose\nT:\tright and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that\nC:\tin terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that\nT:\tokay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or\nC:\tusually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little\nT:\tmm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think\nC:\tfor the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into\nT:\tokay\nC:\ttoo much\nT:\tso a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like\nC:\tI'd\nT:\tlike to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself\nC:\tum I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less\nT:\tokay\nT:\tlike I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community\nT:\tuh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now\nC:\tI'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't\nT:\tuh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four\nC:\tum because I still think it's it's important\nT:\tuh-huh\nC:\tI still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea\nT:\tyeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to\nC:\tI think\nT:\ton that same scale from one to ten\nC:\tI think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I\nT:\toh wow okay why did you say ten\nC:\tit's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather\nT:\tokay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that\nC:\tum I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want\nT:\tso sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or\nC:\tI think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible\nT:\tokay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going\nC:\tI think so that's good\nT:\tdoes that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again

  "T:\tso Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that\nC:\twell I think I'm pretty angry\nT:\tall right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right\nC:\twell she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor\nT:\tthank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body\nC:\twell my neck is really sore and its really paining and and my shoulders I just it's really like it's it just feels like I've been I've been hit by something\nT:\tthe end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did\nC:\tit's made it worse yeah\nT:\tyes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here\nC:\tyou have to help me with that a bit i think\nT:\twe will\n",
  "T:\thi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions\nC:\thi I'm Mario and my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this\nT:\tsure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit\nC:\tmy cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack\nT:\tthat's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems\nC:\tso that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one\nT:\thmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them\nC:\tfirst I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later\nT:\tbased on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum\nC:\tI admit I didn't read the directions last time\nT:\tas for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well\nC:\tyeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much\nT:\twell that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix\nC:\tyeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough it\nT:\tsounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day\nC:\tabout a pack a day\nT:\tokay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know\nC:\tokay I'm gonna try it again and read the directions and stick with it this time\nT:\tone more thing there are two parts to smoking so there are two parts to quitting it's an addiction to nicotine and a habit the patch will take care of the physical addiction and help with the withdrawal symptoms but you'll have to make changes in your behavior if you want to stay quit for good\nC:\tyeah dr. Ward mentioned that to me and he gave me the card for this quitting line\nT:\tthat's perfect our stay quit line is excellent and convenient so let's talk about picking a quit date and we'll get you set up with a box of patches\n",
  "T:\tI can I help you\nC:\tyeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work\nT:\tso your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh\nC:\tno I'm not going to quit smoking oh my god I like it it helps me relax so I mean I don't see what the big deal is\nT:\tokay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the\nC:\tI mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now\nT:\tokay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that\nC:\tsure I can quit\nT:\tokay what makes you so confident\nC:\twell I mean I don't see why I couldn't although I have not ever tried to quit I mean it's just something that I do for fun you know I'm breaks at work in the morning and have to work\nT:\tmm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready I want to quit\nC:\tI am probably - I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today I've been totally not gonna quit smoking\nT:\tokay what made you say two instead of one\nC:\twell I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking\nT:\twell there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke\nC:\tokay well that's good information I mean I'm not gonna do anything today I just need to know my options but that's encouraging if I decided to quit smoking I do have have at least tools to help me quit\nT:\tsure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five\nC:\tI don't know I guess if my friends like if one of my friends decided like quit with me that would probably help too but I all my friends love to smoke so I don't see that happening in the near future\nT:\tsure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit\nC:\tthat's a good point I hadn't really thought about that that's a good idea\nT:\tokay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you\nC:\tokay well thanks a lot\n",

personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas\nT:\tthat's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate\nC:\tit's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal\nT:\tfor sure\nC:\tand it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just\nT:\tso do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far\nC:\tyeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you\nT:\tdo you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done\nC:\toh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off\nT:\thave you tried anything that might have works in past -\nC:\twell we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do\nT:\tit's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies\nC:\tI think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of\nT:\tso you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -\nC:\they I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing\nT:\tdo you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes\nC:\tI think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so\nT:\tso your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good\nC:\tprobably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that\nT:\tcompletion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week\nC:\ttoy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be\nT:\tso it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music]\n",

  "T:\tthere's great seeing you thank you for coming to diabetes clinic today my name is Mark Smith I'm a pharmacist I work with dr. Pham and I we run the diabetes clinic and we basically serve to educate our patients so that I can better manage their their diabetes and looking at your chart I see that you are pre-diabetic so what we're going to do now is kind of focus on nutrition mostly diet and exercise okay\nC:\tdr. Pham already made me get a nutritionist I know what you're going to tell me so Kyle Eve\nT:\tokay okay that's fine I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist I'm she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information do you mind telling me some of the things that she discuss with you\nC:\tit's the same stuff you're gonna tell me\nT:\tokay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast\nC:\tcouple eggs bacon biscuits great\nT:\tokay all right and then what about lunch\nC:\tturkey sandwiches and chips\nT:\tokay chips and then for dinner\nC:\tspaghetti salad bread\nT:\tokay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that\nC:\tI don't really snack but sometimes ice cream after dinner may be free in between meals benign occasion not very often\nT:\tokay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout throughout your day\nC:\tor constant constantly feeling hydrated some thirsty so I drink sweet tea all day long\nT:\tokay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay\nC:\tall right know what you're going to say I need to eat less I've heard it all before it doesn't work for me so good\nT:\tokay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight\nC:\tit's mostly the money it's expensive to buy foods that are healthy and I just can't afford it consistently also like foods it tastes good I hope these stuff doesn't taste good and I just don't want it and also my kids want the good taste in food so they wouldn't even eat it if I made healthy food\nT:\tokay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine\nC:\thonestly I only have one I haven't exercised in years just don't feel like it put all the money to join again\nT:\tokay okay and then what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis\nC:\twell kids they take a lot of time group and money like I said gym memberships or there's several close to my home but they're too expensive for me to get and I just don't have enough time the kids take a ball a day of the day and then work\nT:\tall right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that\nC:\tI guess it's good for you dr. Pham always gets mad at me and says I'm not healthy and always talks about my weight\nT:\tokay\nC:\tmaybe\nT:\tokay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now\nC:\tyeah I mean you can help me with the finances and Ty\nT:\tyes ma'am yes ma'am I believe that so what what we do is we'll schedule a week from now and but it was it was a pleasure talking with you and I very much look forward to working with you okay all right yeah we good rest of the day okay all right\n",

I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do\nT:\tit's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies\nC:\tI think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of\nT:\tso you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -\nC:\they I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing\nT:\tdo you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes\nC:\tI think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so\nT:\tso your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good\nC:\tprobably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that\nT:\tcompletion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week\nC:\ttoy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be\nT:\tso it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music]\n",
  "T:\tcan you talk about the transformation that you see in people\nC:\tit's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that\nT:\tI mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur\nC:\tI think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so\nT:\tso they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave\nC:\tyeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing\nT:\tis there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases\nC:\tI think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually\nT:\tso I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it\nC:\tabsolutely\nC:\tmy wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son\nT:\tthere's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your\nC:\t15 years and I put my step worth on the back burner and I went out I was shooting dope i was shooting heroin a meth in my neck every day and you know working and treatment trying to work there still you know and it's trying to go to this meeting and be secretary still high you know I said I wouldn't get high at work and you know that I'm trying to find a vein in the bathroom all night I had no mental defense against the needle I stole medication I went to sober living after so we're living I used there and i use there and i use there and i go on until i start doing things that are shady since i realized i've been able to put together more than a week\nT:\tis there a willingness or you are you basically giving up\nC:\twhat's what's gonna do this time you know why is this place gonna be magical\nT:\tso what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment\nC:\tanother\nT:\tat this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary\nC:\tI get the all right\nT:\tthank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy\nC:\tno problem\nT:\thow are you doing first of all\nC:\ti'm doing excellent i feel great\nT:\tthere was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says\nC:\tcan I bring my cell phone like I don't know about that but you know I I you went to Spencer Recovery Center and I worked there so I'm able to see the transition as well I don't work in and him with you but Carrie does\nT:\tyou know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place\nC:\tyou know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know\nT:\tbut you've worked hard it hasn't been easy\nC:\tno it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer\nT:\tthe transition that we see just on the outside as well I mean people at home need to see that because when you're working for a facility at one point shooting drugs into your neck and then your back at home wondering how am I everyone do this because every Center that I went to i manipulated it and I ended up pulling one over on them and Here I am again back at home shooting drugs or using suboxone or whatever it is that you were doing I like to just take a few minutes to have your your dad and you have a little boy come up and talk to them just for a fitting\n",
  "T:\twhy miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me\nC:\twell I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something\nT:\tyeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that\nC:\tI suppose\nT:\tokay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit\nC:\the told me to fill that out and bring it with me\nT:\tokay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting\nC:\ttypically\nT:\tyeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive\nC:\twine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased\nT:\tso starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that\nC:\tokay\nT:\tokay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot\nC:\tI fill the glass up so maybe a little more than\nT:\tyeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week\nC:\tso in total\nT:\thow much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that\nC:\tmmm\nT:\tso what do you make of all that\nC:\twell that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive\nT:\tyeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol\nC:\twell you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what\nT:\tso you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you\nC:\tum well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden\nT:\tyeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking\nC:\tyeah kind of defeating the purpose there\nT:\t22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more\nC:\tmaybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress\nT:\tyeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying\nC:\twell I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed\nT:\tand he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way\nC:\tmm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7\nT:\tmm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504\nC:\twell again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities\nT:\tthere's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale\nC:\tum well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress\nT:\tyeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking\nC:\tI'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight\nT:\tokay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but\nC:\tyou know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time\nT:\tso you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit\nC:\twell again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth\nT:\tokay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress\nC:\twell I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of\nT:\tone of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone\nC:\tthat'd be nice\nT:\tright it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future\nC:\tall right thank you very much\nT:\tyou're welcome\n",
  "T:\tso Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now\nC:\tokay Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents did keep me very like kept down out of the lake so like social life and about a month ago my friends they invited me into a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me to like to promise her no alcohol no drugs man I'll pick you up by 12 and I was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come home figure out to delay her call me pick me up later so later so she I promise she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then it's time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and that's exactly what I did\nT:\tso here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence\nC:\tright like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that\nT:\tit's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking\nC:\tI don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like you know like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily\nT:\tso helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed\nC:\texactly\nT:\tsounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe\nC:\tChina\nT:\tany other things\nC:\tjust different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed\nT:\tso your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now\nC:\ta little bit because not all of them are into that so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person there's another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before\nT:\tokay\nC:\tas they are there for me\nT:\twell given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here\nC:\toh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tit's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow it's little I guess it may seem to other people like created it it's a big thing\nT:\tyour mom is really important to you\nC:\tof course\nT:\tand how she feels about you is important\nC:\texactly\nT:\thow important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit\nC:\ta lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my schoolwork again my athletics - okay I feel that there's a feature in that\nT:\thow confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit\nC:\tI'm pretty confident especially\nT:\ton a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when\nC:\tI'm probably like an eighth of nine I mean I can't be a ten just nothing's a 10 in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined\nT:\t- why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7\nC:\tbecause I don't know I feel - turn to determine - to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience it-it's not something that I wish to enjoy so even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking\nT:\tall right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then\nC:\tto make sure I have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if I have time I need your time like oh I'll go party with my friends and just be as I party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do one cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure\nT:\tyour goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most\nC:\texactly just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though\nT:\tyeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something it's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum sounds like something that'll work for you\nC:\tand thank you for listening listening to me that's me\nT:\tyeah that's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I'm gonna hurry up and get changed for practice\n",
  "T:\thi n it's good to see you today\nC:\thi good to see you too\nT:\tin the session before we were talking a little bit about your alcohol use hoping you could you could tell me a little bit more about that\nC:\tyeah it's it's kind of him I kind of had some issues this week again - I was I was at a party and I feel so stupid that I was like you know I did not mean to get that drunk I swear I

another and then I guess that's just kind of when I you know I didn't mean to and I feel stupid but you know I flirted with my boss's husband my boss actually thought it was kind of funny the next day

good to see you again\nC:\tit's nice to see you\nT:\tlast session we spoke a little about your alcohol use over the last few months and I want to get some more information on that if you could tell me a little about that\nC:\tyeah it's um it's not going that well you know after I was here last time I was thinking about what you said and you know I did decide to try you know I decided to cut down a little bit to try to cut down a little bit and it's not that easy\nT:\tno\nC:\tno like last week I went to I went to a party and I was not I was not gonna drink you know I fully intended not to drink

anxious trouble sleeping look like you're shaking a little bit there was this a result of you cutting back\nC:\tno no that's the weird part man I I still like I used to be able to if I downed a bottle of wine in you know it would get me totally drunk but like I said last night I had the bottle of wine and I was like lightly buzzed you know so I'm not really well I did try to cut back after I was in

  "T:\thi this is dr. Grande I hope you find this video useful if that's the case please like it and subscribe to my channel as always thanks for watching\nT:\thello Pepe how you doing today\nC:\tokay how are you\nT:\tI'm good thanks for asking I understand you've come here today to the agency because you have a recent arrest\nC:\tyeah um I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana\nT:\talcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI\nC:\tUm about a week ago\nT:\tokay so what's been going on what is gonna happen\nC:\tum well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know\nT:\tget out of it you mean gonna have the charge\nC:\tyeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that\nT:\tso you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-\nC:\tum I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life\nT:\tall right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to\nC:\tmm-hmm yeah\nT:\tso you're stuck there\nC:\tyeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better\nT:\twhen you drink do you ever socialize at the same time\nC:\tI mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house\nT:\talone safety of the marijuana\nC:\tyeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it\nT:\tso doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using\nC:\tno not really\nT:\twhat are you losing\nC:\tI kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury\nT:\tthis is the alcohol in there one\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tso you take it for pain relief equalities\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tany other reasons\nC:\tum it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using\nT:\tlike forget about problems\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso it affects your mood in a positive way\nC:\tyeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings\nT:\thave you used since you had the DUI\nC:\tum I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using\nT:\talright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law\nC:\tyeah\nT:\thow do you figure those two things out\nC:\tI don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it\nT:\tall right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future\nC:\tum I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again\nT:\tso you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future\nC:\tUm I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again\nT:\tso with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthe first you have to get out of trouble this time\nC:\tyep\nT:\tso if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it\nC:\tI just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them\nT:\tso there is a social component here\nC:\tyeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right\nT:\tso you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink\nC:\tum they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place\nT:\tso it'd be socially awkward\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tstraining the relationships with your friends\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tso the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you\nC:\tNo not at all\nT:\tbut then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it\nC:\tyeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making\nT:\tso you need to make some change\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tbut not the alcohol and drugs\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tsomething else could change\nC:\tyeah I don't know what\nT:\tyou have any theories\nC:\tI mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do\nT:\tso you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain\nC:\tI don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often\nT:\tmmm\nC:\tbecause I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay\nT:\thmm so that strategy might not work\nC:\tI guess not\nT:\tthat's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tis that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to\nC:\tnow that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really\nT:\tyou don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen\nC:\tI don't know\nT:\tall right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person\nC:\tUm go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested\nT:\tThat would do it\nC:\tI would do it get another DUI in the meantime\nT:\tthat wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things\nC:\tI mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part\nT:\tthat's tougher\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tall right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tgoals that you could get behind\nC:\tum I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day\nT:\tyou're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea\nC:\tNo I am not\nT:\tthis is really tough for you the alcohol\nC:\tum\nT:\tthe marijuana that are important to you\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthis whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things\nC:\tUm I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation\nT:\twhat if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail\nC:\tI don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know\nT:\tI would think it almost certainly would have\nC:\tyeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day\nT:\tlet's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana\nC:\tfor about like six years\nT:\tsix years\nT:\thave you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping\nC:\tno\nT:\twhat's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this\nC:\tI just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more\nT:\tyeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come\nC:\tyeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or\nT:\ttill now\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tcould this be in a strange way like an opportunity\nC:\tI mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop\nT:\tif you really wanted to stop could you stop\nC:\tI don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one\nT:\tyou could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it\nC:\tyeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know\nT:\tit's just unknown\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tso where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you\nC:\tum I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then\nT:\tlike a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay do you want to work on that\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tall right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up\nC:\tno they're not for like a few more weeks\nT:\ta few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now\nC:\tokay\nT:\tthanks Pepe\nC:\tthank you\n",
  "T:\tcome on in\nC:\tokay\nT:\they Larry how are you doing today\nC:\tfine\nT:\toh okay alright but before we get started I just wanted to tell you how proud I was a blue and group on Friday night yes that you really really helped Debbie in the role play\nC:\tI am your boss\nT:\tyeah who's that fuzz it's kind of reverse roles like that you know so I just wanted to tell you that you know the whole group appreciated and you did a great job\nC:\tthank you\nT:\tokay all right well I gotta say you look a little agitated\nC:\tyeah well my mother's been bothering me so much about you know all the chores and the laundry and the dishes\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI just can't stand it I'm so busy looking for a job\nT:\tokay\nC:\toh\nT:\twell I tell you what then before we get started in our session let's go through just a real quick breathing exercise just to kind of bring you into the here and now\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou're not where you were an hour ago you have to worry about an hour from now that's just kind of right here okay can we do that we've done this a couple times in grooving in those practice it now it's sufficient being on the floor there we go put your hands on where you're comfortable you sitting up straight you've comfortable closing your eyes\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyes all right so let's not clench your hands you go first thing you're going to do is take a nice deep breath and you're going to blow it out slowly through your lips just like you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake but very slow again to feel the air drove into you sensation on your lips your Grandpa's always your breath is there always there for you to remember that's better you're here and throw it say everything's good so let me ask you question yeah you gonna bring me something or find something\nC:\toh that's right oh I found something\nT:\tthat you could touch your hole\nC:\toh that's beautiful\nT:\tokay so what do you what do you do with it\nC:\twell this I mean I sometimes I put it just so I can feel it on the back of my neck sometimes I put it in my lap\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyou feel better just you know familiar things\nT:\toh that's right so we'll go ahead and keep in your lap now you can touch it and help keep you singers and keep you here\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso now that your little calmer let's talk about what happened with mom before you came here this afternoon\nC:\tokay well I mean she knows that I'm looking for a job and she knows that I'm going to school and just every time I walk in the door she asks me to do the dishes no matter what and I just we get in a huge argument over well you've been home for two more hours and I've been home so why didn't you do the dishes or why didn't you start the dishes and and we scream at each other and I scream we have screaming matches I always try to scream louder than her and then she gets upset\nT:\talright so it's back and forth in the situate a situation escalates and you slam doors and\nC:\twe slam doors and stuff how do I get the impression\nT:\tokay well let's use this situation that has happened to you because today I wanted to actually work on awesome interpersonal would give them and I have a handout sheet to give you and it's called the give technique I want you to take a look at this handout you can take that home with you we're going to talk about this we can directly apply this to what happened today with your mom because this is going to happen again right same situation with your mom so it's a it's a an acronym give giv e why don't you read what those letters stand for\nC:\tokay G gentle be gentle I interested act act interested the validate e easy manner use amazing manners\nT:\tokay so this is just something that when a situation starts to escalate you can just say give\nC:\tokay\nT:\tgentle the interested validate and use an easy manner folks it's something it's really short and quick so in your situation with your mother when she started yelling at you about doing stuff if you thought okay G how would that look\nC:\tG gentle um like it not yellow I could be quieter\nT:\tokay maybe your tone of voice so if you thought gentle that would probably stop in your tone of your voice a little bit and that would be a good response\nC:\tokay\nT:\tokay that's very good good what about act interested\nC:\tI'm going to make eye contact with her\nT:\tokay that's important so she knows that you're listening\nC:\tthe intention that you're paying attention\nT:\tright okay that would be something that you could do quickly and easily okay and what about validate it's an interesting word what what might that how might you validate what your mother is saying\nC:\tI'm I can tell her that I understand that she would like me to help out around the house\nT:\tyes because you know what if you live together is it important that you work together and get everything done nobody likes to do housework but you all have to do it so does she have a good point\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tcan you validate what she's saying that that you do hear what she's saying it's important that you do these things and you know I know that you have a lot on your plate certainly your mother notion have a lot on your plate Taylor right\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou're dealing with a lot so but you can still validate her concerns -\nC:\tokay\nT:\tin an easy manner what would that look like for you\nC:\tum I I mean I kind of aggressive so I guess that could be you know I tried be more light-hearted about the situation if we start getting in arguments like it if we try to tell a joke there's no way I was like and\nT:\tthey kind of difficult to tell a joke in the middle of a heated situation its Butthead but\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou could you could slow down\nC:\tokay\nT:\tslow down and maybe stay calm and just think that think of the letter e easy whatever that that word easy would make you feel\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso what are the three what the four letters again\nC:\tG I\nT:\tG for\nC:\tgentle interested validate easy\nT:\teasy okay good good good good so you're going to take that home and you're going to look that over all right okay put that go ahead and put that it\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tin your workbook so it's a it's a really easy acronym to remember\nC:\tspeaking of acronym I used the stop technique that you taught me\nT:\tyou did yeah I want to hear about\nC:\tthe other day\nT:\toh happy\nC:\tyep the other day I was in traffic and I was getting on the highway and nobody was letting me in you know everybody was cutting me off I was getting so nervous and anxious because I couldn't get on the highway and then what was going to happen if I couldn't get on the highway and I am with a panic attack\nT:\toh\nC:\tand I calmed myself down I stopped\nT:\tstopped is the\nC:\tS\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tI stopped I took a breath\nT:\tT you took it breath and kind of like took a step back okay\nC:\tobserve my observe situation I said if I can't get on my Highway I'll just get off I'll get off and then I can get right back on and then P I proceeded with driving\nT:\toh well I'm so I'm thrilled I'm so happy and it was quick and easy to remember\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\thow did I make you feel to be able to change a behavior like that because ordinarily you would have been cursing and having that anxiety attack\nC:\tright I was trying not to do all those things so I thought you know it to stop I just have to it kind of took me over I took it changed my focus and I had that to focus on so I didn't actually stop in the middle the highway but I you know\nT:\tI am so proud of you that is awesome Taylor think I am just that couldn't be happier and wait till we tell the group\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tthat is no good that would be so good so one more thing I want to give you today one more tool of your little toolkit it's called the opposites and it actually it's in your workbook if you look on page 233 got it if I know anger is one of your emotions that we're working on when I'm is one of our targets here and this has to do with the opposites and you can actually use some of these opposites when you're doing the give technique or when you're doing the stop technique and what it is is that whatever it is that you ordinarily do in response to situations how you react you do the opposite\nC:\tok\nT:\tso we're going to practice this we're going to practice more a group but I want you to kind of get an idea of what it is today so let me ask you a question when you feel angry what do you usually do with your hands\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyeah kind of tight balled up tan\nC:\tright\nT:\tso what would be the opposite of that\nC:\tout to anyone\nT:\trelax we laugh okay so that would be the opposite of that okay so when you feel like going like that okay or or just keep your hands\nC:\topen\nT:\tokay all right let's see what says your stomach muscles in your chest when you're angry what does that feel like\nC:\tusual it kind of punched over tight i hunched over\nT:\tso if you want to do the absolute opposite of that what would that look like\nC:\tsitting up straight stomach relaxed like I'm taking a deep breath\nT:\tdeep breath deep exactly it's hard to take a deep breath when you're like that\nC:\tokay\nT:\tgood that's good good good okay what about your face what if what happens when you're angry you're G you're\nC:\tI clench my teeth\nT:\tyou can let your two together and you know Brown in and tight so what would be the opposite of that\nC:\trelaxed thanks maybe a little\nT:\tmaybe a little smile two little eyes you're up to it nothing fake but this is all meant to be behaviors that you do on purpose so maybe you feel yourself like this you can do it all at once\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand that's something you can choose so got a lot here that you're in your little toolkit for one session so I want you to add this to your homework list\nC:\tokay\nT:\tgo ahead and write this down\nC:\tokay\nT:\tI want you this week to make a list in your journal of the times that you've used your stock technique you've already used at one so go ahead and you can put that could be your first entry\nC:\tokay\nT:\twhen you used your gift technique\nC:\thmm\nT:\tand when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand I also want you to at least once a day do your breathing technique\nC:\tokay\nT:\tokay even if it's just for one minute just to bring you back into the here and now just to bring you into the present and to know that you can breathe and your breath helps you to remain calm okay sounds good all right it seemed very different than when you walked in here half an hour ago so it's um it's good I'm happy for you to it you're making progress I am very excited for you okay I love your little first scarf ever wish I had one just like it\nC:\toh\nT:\tokay\nC:\tokay\nT:\tgo do some good work I'll see you in group\nC:\tokay\nT:\ton Friday night\nC:\tokay\nT:\tall right thanks\nC:\tthanks bye\n",
  "T:\thi Andrea thanks for coming in\nC:\tthank you\nT:\tso I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself\nC:\tsure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that\nT:\twow you really are involved in music\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhen did you start\nC:\tI started playing about 10 years ago actually\nT:\tWow\nC:\tyeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah\nT:\tvery cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun\nC:\tum you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that\nT:\tit's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family\nC:\tuh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog\nT:\tcute what kind of dogs\nC:\tthe golden retriever\nT:\toh nice\nC:\tI'm a big boy\nT:\tvery fun all right and how are things going in school for you\nC:\tpretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish\nT:\tokay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school\nC:\tI'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something\nT:\tokay you have some pretty big dreams\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life\nC:\tum I think a sense of community and belonging\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI think those two and um respect respect\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three\nC:\tyeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI place great importance in that\nT:\tokay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends\nC:\tum sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out\nT:\tmm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved\nC:\tyeah sometimes\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene\nC:\tuh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say\nT:\tmm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking\nC:\tI'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three\nT:\tmm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink\nC:\tthe days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah\nT:\tso it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get\nC:\tdefinitely\nT:\tokay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games\nC:\tI think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tbut in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have\nT:\tokay so there's sort of pros and cons\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tokay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol\nC:\tum it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad\nT:\tokay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol\nC:\tum a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid\nT:\thmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening\nC:\tsometimes yeah\nT:\tcan you tell me a little bit about that\nC:\twell I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun\nT:\tyeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened\nC:\tfor me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and\nT:\tokay\nC:\tit kind of put it down around my my fun\nT:\thuh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol\nC:\tyeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff\nT:\tso you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tgot it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions\nC:\tI just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun\nT:\tokay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then\nC:\tit sort of defeats the purpose\nT:\tright and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that\nC:\tin terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that\nT:\tokay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or\nC:\tusually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little\nT:\tmm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think\nC:\tfor the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into\nT:\tokay\nC:\ttoo much\nT:\tso a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like\nC:\tI'd\nT:\tlike to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself\nC:\tum I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less\nT:\tokay\nT:\tlike I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community\nT:\tuh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now\nC:\tI'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't\nT:\tuh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four\nC:\tum because I still think it's it's important\nT:\tuh-huh\nC:\tI still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea\nT:\tyeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to\nC:\tI think\nT:\ton that same scale from one to ten\nC:\tI think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I\nT:\toh wow okay why did you say ten\nC:\tit's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather\nT:\tokay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that\nC:\tum I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want\nT:\tso sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or\nC:\tI think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible\nT:\tokay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going\nC:\tI think so that's good\nT:\tdoes that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going\nC:\tI'd like to\nT:\talright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks\nC:\tThanks\n",
  "T:\twell let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself\nC:\tI'm pretty obvious\nT:\tso what happened first of all tell me what you did exactly\nC:\twhat you mean what I did\nT:\twell I mean where'd you cut yourself I know you said you cut yourself with a name as always same as always\nC:\tor your arm\nT:\tyeah\nC:\twhere'd you get your stuff left and right there hug it\nT:\twant to see it\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tcan you say hey you can oh those look to me like they they did you go does it it doesn't look like you went and got any stitches but that looks to me like you could have used them what do you think\nC:\tI think have you ever been to it er when you cut yourself even though I don't go\nT:\tokay part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant force so my suggestion is in the future if you do is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed now let's talk about how how this happened list of all tell me you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die but did you assist a suicide attempt or do things just to cutting your thinking about killing yourself of wanting to kill yourself of wanting to die and again\nC:\tthinking about killing myself you thought you would help me and you didn't that's what I want to talk about I want to talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me and you are not available to me when I need help okay\nT:\tso let's okay so it sounds like me not being a bit with me not being available if you rate related to you cutting yourself\nC:\tI cut myself the first time to call you thinking you would help me you wouldn't help me so then I figured what the hell I might as well just go all the way and so that's why I cut myself deep\n",
  "T:\twhat do you feel about the possibility of doing some of that thinking and looking in with another person I hear you clearly saying I don't need you know help I don't need therapy I don't need treatment of any kind but I'm thinking about the exploration area of that and whether or not you have thoughts on how helpful it might be to sit down and be able to sort of chat with somebody about the connection between the alcohol issue and the anger issue and coming back from the war issue and that kind of thing\nC:\ti'd be willing to explore it like I said I think I can handle these issues on my own\nT:\tso here feeling kind of two ways but I kind of feel like to get it on my own but on the other hand I would be willing to talk to somebody\nC:\tright\nT:\tsuch as my girlfriend wants me to do and it sounds like there's some reasons that you've got for doing that one of which is a relationship can you think of other reasons that would support the notion of just coming into to chat again and down the road\nC:\twell I don't like where my anger is at I do not like that if talking to you someone like yourself would would help in those areas and not be willing to do that\nT:\tso the one thing that you and your girlfriend Sharon color is that you want change with respect to this anger issue of the\nC:\tanger issue\nT:\tand it sounds like it needs to change\nC:\tit's just not healthy\nT:\tyeah gotcha so I wonder if I can move that then to this whole issue of commandment I hear you saying pretty loud and clear I am committed to the relationship I will do what it takes and maybe I would be willing to the level of six to come in and chat with somebody about it down the road would it be help for me to to offer you sort of a smorgasbord or a menu of what we have to offer here and see if any of those view at all\nC:\tsure\n",

  "T:\thi mr. snow\nC:\they\nT:\thow are you doing today I'm Bruce Berger I work on the case manager with your health plan I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes\nC:\tyeah I'm supposed to learn how to manage it I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently it's pretty bad because she said my blood sugar was sky-high and she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen that just sounds so disastrous and then she told me I've got to do all this stuff man it's just source disappointment right now\nC:\tso you just you just saw the doctor and you know you sound like you just got blindsided with not only how how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that she you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen on your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things actually\nT:\tmy legs having troubles and\nC:\tso you're really kind of reeling right now from all of that and saying you sound a little bit pretty pretty scared actually\nT:\twell that's yeah it's not just being scared you know I don't want that to happen to me but then one when when she reels off all these things I got to do and I'm sort of you know I'm not certain I can even get it done so it's sort of simple you know I'm sitting here thinking that oh my god this is this is what's going to happen to me as a discourage\nT:\tyes so a slight discard it sounds a lot like on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control and I can't imagine doing all those things so you almost feel like all that bad stuff is going to happen\nC:\tyeah it looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle and yeah all this horrible stuff happens to me I mean it's it's a relief looking situation\nT:\tokay and I and what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down on you know on the one hand you're doctors right you know your blood sugar is very high and we do want to get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen and and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to to get your blood sugar down you know on the other hand we can take this a step at a time so it's not so overwhelming and I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now you know for example there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes taking your medicine as prescribed and honestly if I was going to work on one thing right away given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that do that first because that'll have the biggest impact how does that sound so far\nC:\twell I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines especially since I understand what blood Sugar's really high\nT:\tso that sounds doable\nC:\tyeah I'm pretty good yeah\nT:\tbecause it looks like you need to just take your medicine once a day from from the prescription so that sounds doable right now\nC:\tyeah I think I could probably do that\nT:\tokay the other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits you know to eat healthier not necessarily less but healthier and the other thing would be getting some more physical activity and by the way that doesn't mean going to a gym that means things like more walking maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or escalator stuff like that\nC:\twell she also mentioned the monitoring my blood sugar and all this and that just seemed like them mm-hmm a lot of and that's mumbo jumbo to me yeah\nT:\tthat really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task\nC:\toh okay\nT:\tso it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine when you're changing your eating habits that it's really having an impact than your blood sugar because getting your blood sugar down is gonna keep you from having all those other problems how does all this where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling\nC:\twell I like it that I you know that we can do it as stuff at the time I mean that's that relieves some pressure and being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than I I wasn't certain I could just wait and put this huge programming into effect but doing a step at a time and I you know that getting on the medicine I don't think that's any big problem like that I couldn't do\nT:\tsounds like you're very committed to that\nC:\tyeah I think I could do that as long as there's no big time side effects\n",

  "T:\thi Tom how are you today\nC:\tyeah going well thanks\nT:\tso before we begin let's update your medical history it's important we're doing this at each time because your oral health can affect your general health and vice versa are you taking any new medication as a moment no if you had any major surgery or serious illness in the past six months no have no changes\nC:\tthat's great were there any concerns today\nT:\tyes I've been been in for a while but lately I've noticed these white spots appearing on my teeth they've sure that they're before\nC:\tok shall we check them out. ok Tom so these white spots they're actually the first sign of decay what I'd like to do is help you work how why you've develop our developing them in the first place do you mind if I ask you a few questions\nT:\tyeah sure that's fine\nC:\texcellent so I might do that we might get you to do what's called a risk assessment form so it's just here\nT:\tyep\nC:\tI'm just getting you to fill that one out for us\nT:\tyep\nC:\texcellent thank you says here that you're having one can of soft drink a day but you're spending a bit of time drinking that\nT:\tyeah that's right um usually have it around lunchtime and I just slowly sip it throughout the afternoon that way I don't feel like having another can later I just have the one can\nC:\tthat's great but you only went in here and take a soft drink Tom however it's also important how you drink it do you understand why sugar and acid are bad for your teeth\nT:\tyeah see online all the time about how sugars really bad for your teeth so I try not to eat like lollies and other stuff like that too much\nC:\tthat's great that you're trying to you know limit your intake of sugar and all is it definitely not a too friendly food the issue is sugar is that it feeds the bacteria in your mouth to produce acid and this acid bathing the tooth surface eventually leads to holes and that's why it's really important to limit the time spent sipping that soft drink in the afternoon because the longer your teeth are exposed to that acid the more damage you can do did you know there's actually 10 2 teaspoons of sugar in one can of soft drink\nT:\tno I didn't know that what if I just switched to diet soft drink instead there's no sugar in that right\nC:\twell Tom it's great to think you're being proactive about improving your health other studies show that diets offstring still has a high acid content that dissolves your teeth every time you take a few\nT:\tokay well just like I got the chance can I ask you about this thing I've read online so it's where people swish coconut oil in their mouth and they use that to just stop the hulls from forming and they do that for about ten minutes should I give that a shot\nC:\tit's great to see that you're doing some you know your own research about help online and what you're referring to is actually called oil pulling there's not actually any strong scientific evidence to show that it prevents holes in your teeth I can see that you're really motivated to you know make some changes how about we talk about some ways we can simplify your oral health routine\nT:\tyes it sounds good\nC:\tso first of all getting back to the risk assessment can I suggest that one can of soft drink we try to either drink it all in one go perhaps limiting you to about 10 minutes and even consider using a straw when you drink it\nT:\tyeah well usually have it around lunchtime so I could just have it all in one shot then\nC:\tgreat that will give your teeth a break from all that sugar and acid in the afternoon and perhaps you could keep a glass of water handy instead Tom on a scale of one to ten ten being the most one being the less how motivated do you think you are to make these changes\nT:\twell I really don't want these spots turning into holes so I say about eight or nine\nC:\tgrain and we can talk about other ways you can simplify your drinks between meals\nT:\tyeah sounds good\nC:\texcellent so one suggestion is to keep a bottle of water handy and sip that through the afternoon instead and perhaps even try some sugar-free chewing gum however I'll just try and keep it to ten minutes otherwise it won't lead to a bit of tooth wear and you could get a sore jaw\nT:\tokay then I'll think about those ideas\nC:\toh that's great so what I'll do Tom I'll make a note on your chart and then next time you're in will check in and see how you've gone with that yeah it sounds good\n",
  "T:\tso where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other\nC:\tyeah my as was just been out of control lately and my doctor says it might be connected to Oscar\nT:\thmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse\nC:\tI've got allergy testing it's just the dust makes it bad I thought the smoking was the main thing that's cut down and then they said the drinking might contribute to it too so I got a lot of different things I'm working on so that's what I know the drinking the smoking and the dust that I got the scratch test for\nT:\tright\nC:\tand and that's what I know and that I take the medicine for it\nT:\tokay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern\nC:\tno I've had it for 12 years and now it's a concern I don't understand\nT:\thmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free\nC:\tdoes that work what the boy said yeah\nT:\tokay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards that\nC:\tmm-hmm I'm a little I'm a couple down I used to drink for a night now I'm down to three at least\nT:\tokay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next\nC:\tyeah yeah okay\nT:\tso I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms\nC:\twell we keep him clean like he's clean so all the dander doesn't really make sense but I have been noticing sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside I wheeze a little bit but I think it has to do with um the hair the in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking so I don't know if it's that that's where I'm confused I don't know how this could be happening\nT:\thmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution\nC:\tbut the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit\nT:\tI guess I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long\nC:\tmm-hmm mmm I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I want to feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life in it honestly feels like my my nose is just above the water\nT:\tmmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice\nC:\thmm ya know that feels good that I you know ELISA it is my choice I just feel like just about I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up and I'm kind of sad about things and I don't know I don't know what to do\nT:\tthere's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby\nC:\tyou know I want I want Giancarlo to grow up with Oscar so he has his friend when he's young too and I just it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you got to think about and I'm not feeling good about it\nT:\tmm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not\nC:\tyeah how would I know I don't know I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine if she gave me the strongest medicine and I wasn't working\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tthat would be the way right now cuz I can't see I don't know how I'm gonna give this dog\nT:\toh yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry\nC:\tno no it's something I got to just sit there and kind of put the pros and the cons on the table about but something's going on\n",
  "T:\thi my name is Arielle and I'll be your dietician today\nC:\thi my name is Emily\nT:\tnice to meet you Emily what can I do for you today\nC:\twell my doctor sent me to you because I have diabetes type 1 and I've been struggling with that blood sugar diet\nT:\thave you been keeping up with your insulin injections\nC:\tI have actually but I've skipped some a few times because I heard not taking them actually helps you this week\nT:\tand you have lost weight recently correct\nC:\tyes\nT:\tI see well looking at your anyone C value of 12 tells me that your blood sugar for the past few months has been very high we want to try and get that value down to seven when you skip your injections do you notice anything different or do you feel differently\nC:\tum get headaches sometimes and\nT:\tokay those are actually symptoms of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar let's caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body do you know what ketoacidosis is okay when there is no insulin in the body the cells cannot get the energy they need to function to compensate that your body begins breaking down fat body this is what is referred to as ketoacidosis and this can be very life-threatening by leading to coma Oren's of your cases even death so those experiencing I'd usually have stomach pain nausea sometimes I have breath that's most fruity or like they say it smells like acetone or they have very labored reading what they call Kussmaul respirations and this is why taking your insulin injections it's very important so without it your body can't function\nC:\tOh I dunno about that I knew I was supposed to take them but I thought skipping with you here and there wouldn't be such a big deal\nT:\twell your body is completely dependent on those injections as without them that glucose gets built up in your blood if continued hyperglycemia will develop which is very detrimental to your body and then it's not corrected quickly it will need to ketoacidosis\nC:\tif there's so much sugar in my blood then why or whenever I should get my injections then wait\nT:\tthat's a good question my guess is that all the sugar it needs somewhere to go so your body gets rid of it through urine which is why you're always using the bathroom because you're gonna run up someone to fluid\nC:\twe're going to lose weight\nT:\tyou're basically depleting your wash stores and becoming dehydrated\nC:\toh that makes sense now that explains why I'm so thirsty after I just get injections\nT:\texactly what we want to focus on is keeping your diet and insulin dosage in check also physical activity can help lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight and healthy weight what is your normal diet look like\nC:\twell to be honest I pretty much eat whatever I want the whole carb counting is just really okay\nT:\twell hopefully I can explain carb counting a little more in-depth for you with carb counting our goal is to spread out the consumption of carbohydrates throughout the day in order to normalize your blood glucose so in general 15 grams of carbs equals one serving of carbohydrates so this will make it easier for you and trying to determine how many units of insulin you need to take and after eat a meal so one unit of insulin for 15 grams of carbohydrates at d1 service or however your doctor tells me so how many nails and snacks do you eat today\nC:\tI need three meals and snack appropriately throughout the day so it's a couple of times\nT:\tokay so a starting point I would say aim for about 60 grams of carbohydrate or four servings at each meal and then between zero and 20 grams for each snack which would be about one serving of carb and also with each time you're getting your carbohydrate so at each meal make sure that you're dancing that out with some protein and fat as well so for example if you're eating like a piece of toast maybe put some peanut butter on it so that way you're getting your protein and your fat in there as well so do you know what counts as a carbohydrate\nC:\tbring\nT:\tyes but there are cards instance of other places you find think up like fruits starchy vegetables milk yogurt and sweets and generally the next Rishon table can tell you how many carbs are in something so I haven't had that for you and on this front and up it shows you the nutrition label and it tells you the total carbohydrates and it kind of helps you break down the steps and like how to do the math so in the total carbohydrates you wants to have sugar alcohols and fiber and because you don't completely absorb those those don't quite count in your total carbohydrate so this helps you do the math on that and it makes it a lot simpler and this basically just breaks it down for you completely on the other side I hat side I have listed the some examples of foods that may not have nutrition labels on them so like fruits like apples and bananas they don't usually come with nutrition labels but on here I have like what a serving would be and we come to cards I would be for that surgery it's like one small half would be 15 grams of cards so does this make any easier\nC:\tsure does\nT:\talright well just be sure to keep track at the top calories and fats are consuming as they can add up really fast and lead to weight gain I also recommend staying active as I can how can you lose weight and lower your blood sugar just be sure to check with your doctor on what you can do and then you should take your is one before changing up your routine\nC:\tI will check on that thank you for seeing me and explaining everything in such great detail I will give you my carb counting and another counting another chart\nT:\tmy pleasure I look forward to seeing you and our follow up where we'll check on your progress\n",
  "T:\twhat's going on what are you feeling right now\nC:\tum I'm feeling disgust to Scully about what hope I can't do this like you can't do this\nT:\tso so tell me what that feeling of disgust is what are you disgusted about\nC:\tuh just my body like just I don't know I feel like eating that just makes my body feel you know gross\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tuncomfortable I don't know\nT:\tyeah well it sounds like there's some judgments in there right so it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like I'm feeling really bad yeah\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthat sort of thing\nC:\tyes\nT:\tbut but you did say it more descriptively which is great which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now\nC:\tright just eating that makes me feel icky I don't know just\nT:\tyeah and I can totally understand how you get to there if you're thinking I'm feeling fat I'm going to get fat you know it's an easy place to get to okay\nC:\tokay\nT:\tbut I feel like we're missing something too because I don't think it's just discussed I think there's another primary emotion in there what do you think that might be\nC:\twell I feel like just looking at that I that cake I feel like I just want to run out the door I just I don't want to be here\nT:\tsure so what what emotion do you think that is\nC:\tbeing afraid being fearful\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tof what will happen if I eat that\nT:\tI think that's exactly right that's what I'm seeing you know I see you kind of curled up over there you know you have a very worried face you know and you're having a hard approaching it I think I think that's absolutely right that you're feeling fear and I want you to know that makes a lot of sense to me you know when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake\nC:\tI honestly I can't remember I don't know\nT:\tI know it's been it's been a really long time he certainly didn't need it all through you know when you were really stuck in your eating disorder you know I used to\nC:\tI used to like it I remember that but it was such a long time ago and uh\nT:\tand so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear\nC:\tright\nT:\tand you had said this is one of the hardest foods for you so that makes sense to me\nC:\tright so just see it like as a big blob of fat\nT:\tright\nC:\tthat was that it looks like to me\nT:\tthat's what what what is that it's a big Wobbuffet\nC:\tno judgment\nT:\tyeah exactly you know I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that all right\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso because that's just not going to be helpful right now so what I'm wondering is since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with maybe if we can do some opposite action to that emotion do you remember what I mean by opposite action\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\twhat do I need\nC:\tinstead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this and just you know check out basically right you want me to go towards it and you know just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it\nT:\tright exactly so you know fears associated with that urge like you said to run out the door so instead of running out the door we want you to approach the thing that's scary which is this cheesecake right now right\nC:\tright\nT:\tokay so I see how hard it is for you and I honestly it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away but as you know the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake it's just going to make you more fearful the next time you come in front of some kind of food that's tough for you make it work yeah so by doing this hopefully over time your fear all go down okay\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso can we have the fear right now and still take a few more bites all right\nC:\tokay\nT:\tlet's do it so how was that\nC:\tit's difficult\nT:\tyeah I can see how difficult it is\nC:\twhat I'm doing it but it's not football\nT:\texactly\nC:\tdoesn't feel comfortable\nT:\tno I wouldn't imagine it would but you did perfect opposite action right there which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that but you still did it\nC:\tright\nT:\tdo you feel a little bit proud of yourself\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyeah\nC:\ta little bit\nT:\tokay so this shows me that you can do it so let's try again let's take a breath and then we'll go back and do more opposite action\n",
  "T:\thi George my name is Kaylee I'll be your nurse today I just want to let you know that everything we talk about here is confidential however I do have to let someone know if you're at risk of harming yourself someone else or this child abuse going on is that okay with you\nC:\tyeah that's there\nT:\tokay so George doing a little bit about why you came into the clinic today\nC:\twell I have type 2 diabetes and I can't seem to find the time to exercise\nT:\tokay would you mind if we explore this issue a little further\nC:\tno that's okay we can do that\nT:\tokay so why don't we start by having you tell me a bit about your day and what seems to be getting in the way of you exercising right now\nC:\twell I live a very busy lifestyle and had work I've children I have John you know and then being a diabetic there's so many soft activities that come along and it seemed to have gotten control of everything else but it's just exercise I can't seem to find the time for it and it's very overwhelming and I feel this encouraged\nT:\tokay so it feels like you're having trouble fitting exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty discouraged and frustrated\nC:\tyeah I just found out what to do anymore\nT:\tokay so how important would you say this change is for you to make in your life we'll try on a scale from zero which is not important at all to time which is very important to me\nC:\tthey've always talked about exercise being important to diabetics and I can see how that is important both to me and maybe it's a seven\nT:\tokay pretty important yes and how confident would you say you are right in this moment that you'd be able to make this change and we'll do the same zero to ten scale\nC:\toh goodness um there's just so much I don't think I can make this change maybe a two -\nT:\tokay so hopefully we can get that confidence up a bit and from what I hear you saying it sounds like you have been successful in the past making these changes related to lifestyle and incorporating exercise into your schedule is another really big change that might be really difficult for you to make\nC:\tyeah it might just even be too difficult maybe I should have even come here today\nT:\twell you know what I'm glad you did come in today it shows you're in a serious about your health and you really want to manage your diabetes better I'm sure was really hard to come in especially since you're not sure you if you really want to make this change right now\nC:\twell I know how important it is for to keep my diabetes under control and how exercise can have an impact on my lifestyle and my diabetes but I've tried everything and I just can't seem to find a time\nT:\tokay so it sounds like you know what can happen if you don't incorporate exercise so you know the risks and at the same time life is life is getting in the way\nC:\tyeah like I said that it's I just don't know what to do I know it's important for my health\nT:\tmm-hmm okay so from what I hear you saying you're having difficulty incorporating exercise into your schedule and at the same time you know the importance of exercise and the risks associated with not exercising and being a diabetic is that correct\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay but you mind if I provided you with a little bit more information about the benefits of exercise\nC:\tsure I think that would be beneficial\nT:\tokay good so for a diabetic an exercise can help lower your blood glucose which is very important you can also help lower your blood pressure and the great thing is that regular exercise can also help improve your energy improve your sleep and strengthen your bones and muscles which one of these benefits do you think you would appreciate the most\nC:\twell I would definitely love to have more energy it's very very overwhelming you're having to do all these things they're not advantage I feel so tired and even though I feel tired I don't get any sleep at night I find that I can't sleep so it would be wonderful to have the energy do the things to my day and be able to sleep at night\nT:\tokay so it sounds like you're willing to make a change and you're getting kind of excited about possibly having more energy\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tokay so can you think of any ways you might be able to incorporate exercise interest go to area\nC:\twell I Drive my kids to school every morning kiss them to go to school because I don't start work till like nine o'clock so maybe I could walk them\nT:\tokay that sounds like an excellent plan how many times do you think you could walk them to school this week I assume they go to school every day\nC:\toh yeah they do um I Drive them to school so maybe I can try walking them to school five days a week\nT:\tokay George that would be great that sounds like a really good plan do you think there might be anything that could get in the way of this plan this week\nC:\tno it should be a problem I'm talking so late and the wife sleeps here in the house so I'll be fine\nT:\tokay so great so the plan is to walk your kids to school every day this week and maybe you can keep track of this on a piece of paper just maybe take off every day of the week that you've done your exercise for the day this way you can keep track of things visually and you know you can watch your progress okay so if you have any problems during the week please feel free to call the clinic and ask for myself or another nurse although this is your decision ultimately we are going to support you along the way I don't want you to ever feel like you're lowering this and we will we'll play to meet in one week to see how things are going and hopefully we can follow up after that and get that confidence level up\nC:\tokay wonderful I'm glad to have you as it's important that you\nT:\tthanks so much for coming in today I really commend you for taking that first step towards change thank you George\nC:\tthank you can we for your help\n",

confident that things will continue on it you can maintain what you've been doing and that's great you're not a zero\nC:\twell yeah like Cyril\nT:\twell what makes you a seven and not a four in terms of confidence\nC:\tI guess that's just the way I am is just tough and it can be done in maybe do it\nT:\twell because you've been doing it and you've been consistent and successful with it\nC:\tcorrect\nT:\tand what would it take to make you be a nine in terms of being more confident that it'll happen all the time\nC:\toh just another couple days on the bike a couple days out good\nT:\tso what I'm hearing you say is that's kind of what you're wanting to get to is being able to global add a little more to what your schedule is and how do you see yourself doing that\nC:\twell that's the child because if you go to meet people for breakfast at seven thirty eight o'clock\nT:\tWow 730 a clumsy\nC:\tand try to ride a bike before and shower and stuff ahead\nT:\tthat means you're getting up pretty early\nC:\tso you do it in the afternoon what a ton of degrees no that doesn't work either so evenings maybe\nT:\tokay so of course the Florida whether you've got those hundred degree humid temperatures where you feel like you're hot then you get on the bike\nC:\tright\nT:\tisland by the evening is it is it cool down some and we committed to taking off a little need me\nC:\ton the rare occasion all day\nT:\thuh so that it's kind of picking those days of window I feel like going out there do I feel like sweating right now on the bike\nC:\tthat's it\nT:\tuh-huh so that seems kind of like your next focus on just trying to implement that\nC:\tyeah a little more be good but\nT:\twell it sounds like you know you're doing a lot to really think about your house and to have a balance between what you're offering to other people but also taking time for you do you do anything just do do anything just for you time just to you know be able to just have your own time to enjoy and mind\nC:\tlike grab a good book\nT:\tmmhmm\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tgrab a good book that's always a great way to\nC:\tpersonal leadership\nT:\tuh-huh\nC:\tlooks\nT:\tand you find that that gives you\nC:\twhat yeah not one of those fluffy novel things\nT:\tnone of the fluffy Harlequins or whatever that the women like to watch read huh\nC:\tyeah note those\nT:\tleadership something that gives you some more tools to work with folks that have some depth to them well that sounds great if we could just perhaps maybe talking you know a couple maybe four to six weeks and kind of see how that bicycling is going for you and just know I'm here for you and\nC:\tthat's good so you're going to be here\nT:\tyeah I'd love to continue to be your support\n",
  "T:\thi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by\nC:\twell I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well I think it's important to quit but I enjoy smoking I'm not ready to give it up right now my life is too much in turmoil\nT:\tso I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about\nC:\tI think it's important because I I feel like I'm a bad role model for my children and my daughter's turning 12 and already some of her friends have tried smoking so I don't want her to think it's a good thing\nT:\tso the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking\nC:\tI smoked when I was young and I'd certainly don't want it for her\nT:\tand it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately\nC:\twell that's true it seems so hard I'm just not ready for this right now\nT:\tso Sandra what's good about smoking what do you like about it\nC:\tit's very enjoyable relaxing you know it's stress reliever when I'm at work we all go out and smoke and chitchat and you know talk about things I would hate to not smoke really I'd be left out\nT:\twhat else tell me what else is good about it\nC:\tmmm I like to have a cigarette after I eat it sort of tells my brain I'm finished stop eating I'm full so it's it's a way to you know sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack so it's a way to control my weight\nT:\tokay so is there anything else that you like about it\nC:\tlet me think well I just enjoy it I think it's it's not good for me I know but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much\nT:\tso let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke\nC:\tthat's true yeah\nT:\tyou also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you are we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking\nC:\texactly mm-hmm\nT:\tso I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things\nC:\twell I I'm worried about my children I feel like I'm being a bad parent and I often wonder you know they've seen me smoke for years I certainly don't want my 12 year old daughter to start smoking and some of her friends are already smoking\nT:\tSandra can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her\nC:\tyeah just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up there she was looking out the window watching me smoke\nT:\tso this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you\nC:\tI felt terrible you know I was projecting I want to be a good parent and I don't feel this really parted the plan\nT:\tand again thanks for your honesty in talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know on the one hand you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tand on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together\nC:\tit doesn't fit you know it's the opposite side of the coin you know I'd love to do it but I don't think it's right\nT:\tso why would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you\nC:\twell I can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about\nT:\tso it's it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me\nC:\texactly\nT:\tokay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful\nC:\toh sure sure I'll come in tomorrow\nT:\tnot necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you willing to do that can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week I promise it's not too time-consuming we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change why you would even consider quitting smoking and then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days\nC:\tokay okay I'll give it a try\nT:\tokay here you go\nC:\tthank you\nT:\tso thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week\nC:\tall right\n",
  "T:\tI just I do today\nC:\tI'm alright I'm going a little weird lately and I can't explain it I'm just I feel off you feel off I just feel really often not like myself and just not like I'm normal like I think that normal person should be feeling right now\nT:\tyou're not feeling like a normal person should be feeling\nC:\tI'm feeling a little anxious a little jittery a little I I don't know I just I just feel weird\nT:\tI said you have some anxiety but you're not really certain of the feeling\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\tokay I want to ask you a bit of an unusual question that is going to take some imagination to answer I want you to bear with me if you can okay so let's say that we we know you have this problem describing this partially anxiety based at least say that you were to go home tonight and attend to usual chores and you're to go to sleep so you're asleep and sometime during the night miracle curse and the problem you're having right now and its entirety is gone so the next morning you wake up but you don't know the miracle has occurred that makes sense\nC:\tit makes sense\nT:\tso at this point as you wake up you don't know the miracle has occurred how would you recognize the problem is going\nC:\tI think I would just feel better like I don't know maybe not be jittery you know I can't be\nT:\tjittery\nC:\tyeah maybe I mean I don't know maybe I would just I would just feel better on the inside\nT:\tI try to try to think that's good trying to think specifically like you first wake up now let's go through let's go through your day say first wake up this miracle is occur but you don't know it's occurred\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso you don't know about the miracle you wake up believing that you would still have the problem\nC:\tokay\nT:\teven though the problems not there\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso let's move through let's move through the day and see when you would be able to recognize or what you would recognize so it's different\nC:\tI think during the first half of my day I just it like when I wake up I do all the normal things I make my breakfast shower shave all that stuff and I generally don't feel jittery then it's just when I start to actually go out of the house and just thinking about getting to work and stuff it starts to just get a little jittery on the inside\nT:\tso you may not notice the problems go on when you're still home\nC:\tcorrect um but I think that once I actually got like to my office space I think that that's when I'll start to say hey you're you're you're not filling all jittery your palms are not sweating you're not being you're not really anxious about going into work today and something just starts to click and it's like hey this is just feels right instead of this feels wrong and I should here or I shouldn't want to feel like this alright\nT:\tso the moment you get to work is when you think you'd really recognize that something about the problem has changed that it might be gone\nC:\tI think so and I think more I would actually understand or see the miracle had occurred is actually when I started to interact with my co-workers because I think that there that's where a lot of the jitteriness occurs or at least that's what I've been noticing that I'm seeing that anytime I'm really starting to interact with my co-workers that I my heart starts to raise my hand starts to get sweaty I I don't know what to say I don't know what to do and I think that if all of that started to disappear then I think that I would notice that\nT:\tso that moment when you start to interact with your co-workers you would you would notice that you're not reacting in the way that you're used to react\nC:\tcorrect\nT:\twhich sounds almost like almost like intense anxiety or panic will you describe it\nC:\tI I never really thought about it like that because I think that that's something that this naturally always been happening and it really never occurred to me to look at my work situation to see if by eliminated that or those people that all of the anxiety would go away because I think that even though when I come home I'm still thinking about working stuff is still happening and I'm still worrying about how I'm going to work with these people that I still have a little jittery but I'm not as jittery or sweaty or whatever especially when I'm at the office\nT:\tso so the largest chance you're going to recognize the problem is going is during that in the office first really so there might be an after effect that you would it's going to be absent on your way home\nC:\tcorrect\nT:\tbut you feel like the symptoms the problem are really strongest at the often\nC:\tcorrect yes right yes I would say 100% yes when I'm especially when I'm interacting with this people it's specially large groups of people I think that that's when it really pops in and it just I just don't know what to do with myself and I think I could see that if I we had a say a group meeting um I think I would really notice that them because I wouldn't be worried about what I'm saying or how other people are viewing me or if people think I'm dumb or anything like that I think that it I would just be able to say what I needed to say\nT:\tso the problem wasn't there you'd be relaxed and confident during these meetings\nC:\tyeah I think I would be I think being really confident and also I would be very short myself because I would know that this is what I'm saying it's right what I'm doing is right and I wouldn't have to worry about if my coworkers talking about hi my bag or if my coworkers laughing like I wouldn't even care if they're on their phones because I know that what I'm presenting is going to be round alright so\nT:\tit it seems like I've used to this question which we called a miracle question\nC:\tokay\nT:\tit seems like it's helped you to identify what's going on a little bit it sounds like a social anxiety type symptom that they have going on\nC:\tokay all right\nT:\tthat's something we can certainly work on perfect and maybe it's giving you some insight into how that social anxiety seems to function throughout the day when it's more intense at work less less intense as you come home and in the morning we wake up really it doesn't seem like it's too bad at all so it's giving you an idea how those symptoms I've been flow through the day and what they might mean what might be causing them\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tso it makes sense\nC:\tthat things could complete that's I think\nT:\twe'll work on it don't work want to put some more framework around it but give that some thought what's going on the problem in terms of when it occurs you kind of you're recognizing habits work and reflect on that a bit and then I'll see you again about a week and we'll start moving through and see what we can do about the social anxiety\nC:\tokay perfect\nT:\tthat's how good Jeff\nC:\tthat sounds wonderful\nT:\tI'll see you then thanks a lot\nC:\tthank you\n",
  "C:\tthen go ahead and have a seat right here\nT:\tall right perfect\nC:\tyou have all kinds of fun stuff for us today right I didn't change my ways\nT:\tare you ready for that\nC:\tI am ready all right very excited\nT:\tgood well I am too and it's a pleasure to be here thank you for trusting me I've got the questionnaire that you filled out earlier for us and I brought that with me today\nC:\tokay\nT:\tI made a few notes for myself and I want to go through and ask you some additional questions but before I get the questionnaire out for us to begin talking let me tell you a little bit about today and that today is about you I'm gonna be asking you quite\nC:\twell I never hear that very often\nT:\tI thought you might enjoy that\nC:\tall right\nT:\tso I'm gonna be asking you some in-depth questions and some of them you may have questions about why I'm asking the questions and you're perfectly okay to to ask me about that if that comes up for you I'm I can answer your questions as well but what I'm gonna be doing is asking you things about in detail about what kinds of things you eat and also other lifestyle things and that will help me put together a program for you moving ahead so thank you for the advance work that you did and thanks for your patience as I get the bag out here\nC:\tI'm anxious to see I analyzed all of that\nT:\twell you know something you're um you are really already pretty far ahead in the in the continuum of things now that this is something that we should be judging it's not like there's a good way or a bad way and one of the things I say to my clients is this if we look at the way that we eat and we live our lifestyles as a continuum with one end of the spectrum being the standard American diet and people who we know are doing some unhealthy things and then at the other end of the spectrum you've got the really really really healthy people that you don't ever want to be around because they make you feel guilty for everything you do and every choice that you make yes we all do and if you can find a spot for you on that continuum that fits for you at any particular given period of time that's what it is that we're trying to do here and it's not a judging thing it's not that you're trying to get from one fit place together and and remember this also Michelle as we work together there will be points in time when you will feel like you're on top of the world and you're doing good job and something may happen for you that causes you to have a little bit of a setback maybe stress at work maybe something happens in your personal life whatever or maybe it's the holidays and you're celebrating and you might have what you would call quote a setback it's not the end of the world and we'll talk as we go along about how to address those types of issues how to deal with those how to head them off at the pass so this is an ongoing continuum kinds of thing and remember it's a lifestyle this isn't a diet and so\nC:\tright absolutely\nT:\tthat's where we're going with this so\nC:\tthat's why that's why I like you and your approach and I think it's gonna be a nice fit for where I'm trying to get in my family and so let's do it\nT:\tabsolutely the first couple of questions that I asked had to do with what what it was you consumed and I asked whether or not you ate meat chicken fish and so forth you're not vegetarian according to this and so you do eat some of those things talk to me a little bit about the sources of the food that you get the meat product\nC:\tthe sources I tried to buy you know is organic as possible that's not always the case you know sometimes we buy it in bulk we try to access the farmers that are in this area\nT:\tok\nC:\thave it available and for me personally I've you know meat isn't a focus of when I'm putting a meal together but my husband you know is a meat eater and so I try to incorporate it into things more for for his you know satisfaction than anything and you know it's not we don't need a lot of it but it is part of our Cherno part of our diet\nT:\tok and I'll I'm gonna hit the pause button for you and tell you you know that I am personally and vegan and I'm a raw foodist\nC:\tright\nT:\twhen I ask you these questions again it's not from a judging perspective it's not because I'm gonna say to you well we're gonna cut meat out of your diet in a hurry that's not the case at all what I'm asking the reason I'm asking is so that when I build things for you and build a program for you I'm accommodating the things that you're comfortable with if there are things that I ask you for example if you say I do eat meat now I don't want to and then we'll talk about that so that's where that question is coming from so I'm delighted to hear that you're conscious about the sources of your meat products or get\nC:\tperfect with it by any means sometimes it's what's available or I'm in a hurry or we're having people you know and but I do try to yeah get it\nT:\torganic and local that's\nC:\tit natural yeah it's possible\nT:\tthat's wonderful and then obviously you're aware of hormones and antibodies and those kind or antibiotics and those\nC:\tright\nT:\twe can let's leave that out yeah and the same thing with dairy products you've got some dairy products on your repertoire talk about that\nC:\theavily I'm not a milk drinker but I do like cheese\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand so and I cook with milk you know of course but I'm not I haven't drank milk since I was little\nT:\tokay\nC:\tbut I do like cheese and probably eat a lot of cheese and eggs and that but um you know I and like I said it would same with the meat I don't know that I want to do away with any of it but I just want to kind of what naturally evolves and happens with I just want to you know be smarter about how we prepare things and where we're getting it from then\nT:\tright\nC:\thow we're putting it together\nT:\tdo you ever have any ill effects from the dairy that you can sue\nC:\tno\nT:\tokay so you don't have a digestion issue\nC:\tI know I I'm pretty I I don't really have any ill effects from anything that I eat very very rarely\nT:\tand the rest of the family is okay with that too okay good so when I'm asking the questions I'm primarily asking about you but if it if it comes up that somebody in your family if I hit a hot button and you say oh I don't have sinus problems but my my offspring do or my feelings do or whatever then let's talk about that as well um you have you have a husband\nC:\tyes I do and the daughter this turns 8 this month\nT:\tWow okay and no ill problem no health problems\nC:\tno\nT:\tokay\nC:\tnot with any of us\n",
  "T:\thello kelsey thank you for coming in today I'm Shelley see our own personal trainers I shall be through you um so why are you here today there's some behaviors you want to change anything that you want to take care of\nC:\tyeah I'm here because I would like stop eating so much sugar primarily in the form of candy\nT:\tokay\nC:\tas I work out a lot i would say high intensities and I just feel like I'm always striving for this healthy lifestyle but then I will eat soon so girls in one sitting and it kind of ruins everything that I'm working toward\nT:\tall right so um what are some pros and cons to eating candy\nC:\twell pros aren't that is delicious\nT:\tit is\nC:\tand cons obviously it's not good for anything down the road I don't want to make it a habit because I honestly don't want to develop any chronic diseases or um it enables me to not lose weight even though it's not really goal but kind of always the goal um it doesn't make me feel good afterward that's for sure\nT:\twhat was that\nC:\tis enjoyable in the moment\nT:\talright so what I hear you saying is that you really enjoy how can you taste and it makes you feel good at the moment I'm assuming because you're getting the pleasure oh you can't be um but afterwards you just you don't like the way that makes your body feel you feel bogged down and gross and then potentially see the side effects of maybe unwanted weight gain and things that you're striving to prevent\nC:\tyeah that's exactly\nT:\tokay so on a scale of 0 to 10 how much do you think you can make the change to quit eating candy\nC:\twell this has been a repeated effort for me so I'm going to say about a 7 because I feel like I can do it but I work around a lot of candy there's candy on my desk so it's kind of hard to resist\nT:\tokay well it's not a zero so you have some confidence in yours\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tall right um so when you say that you have candy at work is there any way you can get rid of that\nC:\tnow because I work for an athletic director and the can use for the athletes post bay but\nT:\tsometimes just thank you know the cookies over or katie jo should i say all right so what are your goals how do you see yourself quitting in canyons\nC:\twell i would like to start making like a foo dog and not lying to myself about how much candy i'm actually eating when i eat 32 the rules i should write down that I didn't\nT:\tall right that's started\nC:\tyou know maybe check that for six weeks and see if actually looking at how much candy I meeting will help me realize that it's\nT:\tokay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating\nC:\tright yeah I'm going with that do i can write down you know how much i sleep or what else i'm eating and see if the g3 some candy helps with other\nT:\tokay\nC:\tlifestyle factors\nT:\tgood good i understand that it's really hard quitting kidding i myself have been known in the past you eat a ton of canyon or the city right right this or can you explain me again just some more reasons why you think it's going to be hard and why you think you can do it\nC:\twell i think it's gonna be hard because i work every day but monday that it's on my chest tuesday and thursday i work in the morning so it's less likely for me to snack on it i don't really know why i just don't think about it in the morning and i'm only there for three hours so that would definitely be a reason why i would have a hard time resisting it but this this last week I've been putting up signs from the candies door that says no candy all right Pizza sticky\nT:\tokay no good that's a good story\nC:\talways help quick\nT:\tand can you clarify for me one more time the kind of pleasure you get from eating candy\nC:\twell obviously taste I'm sure it stimulates some sort of happy memories\nT:\tokay\nC:\tum you know how we Easter Christmas is all about the candy\nT:\tyeah so what you're saying is that candy brings back good memories and it tastes good and it makes you happy but at the same time it frustrates you and you're having a hard time letting it go because of work I mean it's hard to get rid of things when they're so prevalent in your life and candy is everywhere we look\nC:\tbut strong\nT:\tso I would just like to understand a little bit more on how you're going to put definite goals I'd like to write down four goals for you on how we want to derail your need for handy\nC:\tokay well so the first one I'm going to do is log my I think I'm gonna log all night and day\nT:\tokay\nC:\tincluding candy\nT:\tgood\nC:\tand fruit could probably be it would be a definite factor in that as well um secondly I'm going to continue to put up those post-it notes in front of the candy jar saying that I should not eat candy network\nT:\tokay\nC:\tum thirdly I have a Fitbit and I was thinking about writing like no sugar really small bed in it you know just as a reminder just when I think that nicca now probably shouldn't what do you have any suggestions about what\nT:\thave you ever considered maybe talking to your boss I'll moving the candy jar from the table to maybe an instant table next to the door or something so it's out of reach\nC:\tright every two no I haven't but that's a good idea or even talk to him about so Jana with fruit or really anything else besides candy\nT:\tbecause really i mean its athletes we're working with you and athlete like yourself\nC:\ti'll be passing out candy\nT:\tshould not be eating candy do i think that you can maybe make a push and get some gratification for yourself out of improving the lives of others one for being your own\nC:\tI think that a very good idea\nT:\tok so you're really willing to make this change apparently\nC:\tyes I want to make this change\nT:\tok um and you've already started you started with the post-it notes um my only other suggestion if you don't mind me giving you a suggestion\nC:\thow about that um\nT:\twould be like you said with the fruit consider all of the food you're taking in because sometimes after you exercise your body crave sugar because you're not getting enough complex car such as like bread or rice or something like that before you workout so your blood Sugar's just dropping so just monitor the way you feel more than just the pleasure since you get from the delicious\nC:\tyeah all right\nT:\tdo you have any questions\nC:\tno I think that we've caught with a really good plan here and I'm excited to give it a go this week\nT:\tall right well I'm excited for you so I'll will take a look at the log and we'll reevaluate these goals here in about two weeks and we'll see how the candy is going hopefully your boss will work with you some\nC:\tokay\nT:\tall right well thank you\nC:\tthank you\nT:\tgood day\nC:\tgood\n",
  "T:\thi Patrick\nC:\they\nT:\tmy name is Christina I'm gonna be the therapist today nice to meet you too so before we start I want to know if it was okay if I take notes \nC:\tsure\nT:\tokay great so can you tell me a little bit about why you're here\nC:\tum no because I don't really know why I'm here my dad kind of just forced me to come\nT:\tokay why do you think he forced you to come\nC:\tno he's always forcing me to do stuff like whenever he wants me to do something he's always makes me do it it's not been asking if I want to do it you know it just makes me do it I never had these issues when I go visit my mom my mom was in New York and whenever I go visit her she's a lot more lenient she understands that if I have something that I need to get done I'll get it done she doesn't anyhow meet every second of the day to make sure I get it done if I want to go to Times Square as long as I stay within her rules and follow our rules she's okay with it the other week I went to Times Square with a friend and we hung out and it was a great day we got to go to Central Park we got to do all the stuff that I wouldn't been able to do if my mom had forced me to stay home I mean New York is an incredible City being able to walk around it explore it's so much fun and I just I mean I wouldn't be able to do it if I had been forced to stay at home I wouldn't have gone the neighborhood of Liberty we went and we just explored around and found all these cool little hidden places that we had never gone to before and it was so much fun\nT:\tawesome okay so um New York time look it was amazing let's go back to your dad so you said your dad made you come here is that right okay so can you tell me a little bit aSbout why you're frustrated looking\nC:\tI mean I don't really I guess it's just like I said because all of these making me do stuff that I don't want to do and he's always on me to do stuff that I have to get done I'm 17 years old he doesn't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done and he doesn't always he doesn't have to make me do stuff I don't want to do for example he always wants me to go to the store I don't always want to go to the store with him but it doesn't matter what I want he makes me go he food shopping he going to the fishing store the sporting goods store going to get crafts because he's a huge crafter like I don't need to go to those stores I don't want to go to those stores why does he make me go to these things doesn't since I don't do crafts another crafty person\nT:\tyeah totally okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is always making you do things like chores and making you you go with him to places that you don't really want to go to is that right\nC:\tyeah it's not so much the chores like I understand that totally bugs I have to get those done and that's the thing is I understand what I need to get stuff done I know when I have to do my homework I know when I have to do my chores I know when I have to get up and go to school I understand all that but even those things he's constantly on me to do he's constantly as soon as I get home from school or home from work do your homework do this do that I understand that I have to get it done he doesn't need a tummy when I get home from work I'm tired I mean I work on my feet all day I work at a coffee shop like I'm serving customers and I'm often tiring at home and I don't want to do my homework I shouldn't have to do my homework maybe I just want to want to be or play games or play computer\nT:\tokay so do you think that your dad doesn't understand that you're tired\nC:\tI don't even I don't know about that I mean I think he understands I mean he gets it it's just you constantly on me to do stuff and I don't know why I don't\nT:\tokay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is micromanaging a little bit\nC:\ta lot of it yeah he is trying to control every second of my life like I said I'm here I am he made me come here I didn't want to come here and offends you I'm sure you're a great person I'm sure you have a lot of friends and whatever but I don't want to be here that's just he made me come\nT:\tokay so why don't we try something if that's okay with you I want you to talk to the chair like as if your dad was there I want you to tell the chair or your dad how you feel\nC:\tlike that\nT:\tyep\nC:\tI guess I would just say that tell him that I don't need him controlling every aspect of my life at\nT:\tbefore you continue can you try to talk to the chair as if your dad was sitting there\nC:\tlike actually look out of the chair okay I guess I would just say dad listen like you don't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done like I'm 17 I am gonna be going to college soon I know how to control what I need to get done in my life I know how to manage everything like don't get me wrong I know that you probably just have my best interests at heart but I don't need you every 10 seconds saying make sure you do this make sure you do that you need to do that you need to do that every now and then is a different story if you really want me to go to the store with you every now and then that's not that big a deal it's just when it's every single time that I've had the issue or if you just take the time and say every now and then it'd be like hey just don't forget you have to do this if you knew that like once every every we've got a couple of times a week even just once a day something like that it's gonna be a lot better than you just constantly saying make sure you get this stuff done\nT:\tokay can you tell me about how that talked you're talking to the chair talking to your dad\nC:\tdifferent I mean I guess I kind of realized that I might need a little angry with him and that might be why he want me to come but I mean it got it felt kind of nice to get that off my chest instead of just holding it in\nT:\tgood okay so it sounds to me like you're a little frustrated we get that I get a little angry that you are having a hard time with him telling you what to do you feel like you're an adult is that right so you feel like you're an adult you feel like your dad doesn't really understand that that there's kind of an imbalance there okay so I think we had a really good first session I want you if you can come back next week and we're gonna try to figure out how to talk to your dad so he can better understand that is that okay\nC:\tsure all right it was nice to meet you see you next week\n",
  "T:\thi Quinn I'm glad that you came to see me today my name is me and I'll be your nurse what would you like to talk about\nC:\tof your current myself if it's really from Captain tanner I'm also worried about my house will get worse if I don't exercise more\nT:\tsounds like you're concerned about eating too many five foods and not exercising enough so which of these two concerns would you like to focus more on today\nC:\tour men testing within our society it's very important to control my blood sugar I'm finding it hard to attempt to exercise know since that I have to work five days a week and took it comes with my kitchen so I guess which the starter there\nT:\tokay well I appreciate you bringing it up it's true many people diabetes find it hard to add exercise to your life especially when their busy schedules it must seem overwhelming to have to fit exercise into your life when you have so many other priorities\nC:\tyes exactly\nT:\tso tell me what's living with diabetes been like for you\nC:\twe are it had done w day I hope to watch what are you or the fam make sure I don't care you have a pic of my accident a top of that everyone goes to me I need to exercise and I really don't like ecstasy\nT:\tyou must be so stressful how to make so many changes to your life because of your diabetes adding exercise to your list of things to do isn't making your life any easier you mentioned that you don't like exercising so maybe we can look from your perspective what exactly you think that and the disadvantages of exercise our first of all what exactly don't you like about exercising\nC:\tit's so difficult to get started and to keep a movie I'm so tired after work I the rugged Esther real taxa and the CTL my culture and watched TV on the spend more time with my children\nT:\tyou struggle with exercising because you're already tired after coming home from work and exercise increases your fatigue\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso tell me then what are the benefits of exercising to you\nC:\tI know then it becomes the to decrease to my blood pressure on me to lower my blood sugar that is not so tightly that's what the doctors decide\nT:\tyou understand that exercising here and prove your overall health\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso where does that leave you now\nC:\teven though I know that our society of happily managing my sugar levels I just don't feel once are their facades\nT:\tso as long as you feel fine you don't see the need to exercise\nC:\toh that's right\nT:\twhat if you felt that your house was getting worse that you're starting to feel the symptoms of your diabetes even though the symptoms of type 2 diabetes develops slowly in the early stages and can go unnoticed for years if blood sugar is left uncontrolled it can lead to many complications would you like me to tell you more about that\nC:\tnext room\nT:\tfor example diabetes can lead to health problems like hypertension nerve damage or even kidney disease\nC:\tbecause sorts as a lot you take insulin if you have to control your blood sugar and I may enjoy fried food sometimes but most of time and prettily almost alcohol\nT:\tthat's true insulin is a big part of glucose control and it's also great to hear that you're able to maintain a healthy diet despite your busy schedule that's quite an accomplishment exercise can also complement these effects actually exercise can help your bodies up your blood sugar and has been proven to be more effective or even or just as effective as medication\nC:\twhat heck yes\nT:\tso it seems that being healthy is pretty important to you and that having symptoms of diabetes or feeling sick worries you\nC:\tbecause I want to be able to take home for my kids they are i still can I don't want to be sick and unable to see them grow up\nT:\tokay let me summarize what we just talked about you're not sure that you want to be here today the only reason you came is because your doctor felt that exercising more would help you manage your diabetes at the same time you haven't been feeling any symptoms of your diabetes so that's why I don't feel the need to exercise but if indicated that you want to prevent feeling sick and you like to be healthy for in order to take care of your children in fact you're ready doing so many things to help look after your health such as taking your insulin regularly eating a healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol did I miss anything\nC:\tno that's correct\nT:\tI see where you're coming from normally in order to control her blood sugar you have to live a healthy lifestyle you're ready doing a great job doing that by taking your insulin on time eating regular regularly and healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol so the only other thing you can do is exercise but you don't see the need to exercise and you find it hard to fit into your schedule\nC:\tsorry i don't like society but i do want to keep the interesting to look of mine are you saying lanta i can stay here say it even access long\nT:\tyes that's exactly what I'm saying\nC:\tI'll be like this I coulda tried to start seeing them\nT:\tall right if since you wanted to exercise would you mind if we took some time to find out how i feel about exercising\nC:\tokay\nT:\ton a scale of zero to ten in terms of how important you feel they need to exercise zero being not important and 10 being very important how important do you think exercises to you\nC:\tI'm 17\nT:\tseems that you think that exercising is pretty important then how come you're at a seven and not a two or three\nC:\tlike Isis are that I don't want to this point of my kids I'm in too sick to care for me I will marry to do anything for them\nT:\tthe thought of not being able to take care of your kids scares you you must love them very much\nC:\tyeah more than anything in the world\nT:\tnow let me ask you how confident you are from the scale of zero to ten where zero is not confident at all and 10 is very confident in order to regularly exercise\nC:\tI remember I've had a hard time exercising you know Carston because I've been so Carrie I just took tore down on the treadmill for 30 minutes but it was hard to do that every day I think I meant for\nT:\tso you're moderately confident what would help increase your confidence\nC:\tI mean I guess if I had the more encouraging them to exercise and or the increase in my confidence also it would exercise so tearing that we're gonna have to\nT:\tin the past what is help you to continue exercising\nC:\tsometimes to my husband would encourage exercise but not the loss of him\nT:\tmore support from your husband would help you to continue exercising maybe we can also explore additional options as to how to motivate you to exercise\nC:\tlike what\nT:\twell you mentioned that you think exercising will take away from the time you want to spend with your children would you consider including your children in your exercise routine\nC:\tthat's a risky idea i guess i put the puller you some games this then we really repre\nT:\tand you mentioned earlier that you used to run to exercise but running is a very high intensity exercise it would be hard for anybody to run for 30 minutes a day would you what exercises do you think would be easier for you to try\nC:\tmaybe you're walking\nT:\twould you be willing to consider walking for 15 minutes after dinnertime\nC:\tthat's what a walk\nT:\tthat's a great start would you like to schedule an appointment next week to discuss more about your fried foods consumptions and other ways we can help you to keep exercising\nC:\tthank you\n",
  "T:\twe'll there's some things that have come up in in what I've seen so far I I just want to talk to you about your blood pressure it looks higher than I'd like and and obviously that concerns because there are some things that can happen with high blood pressure and I got to point out that the smoking in combination with the blood pressure concerns me and there may very well be cause and effect I'm sure the last thing you need is is somebody to to nag you but could we talk a bit about your smoking\nC:\tyeah sure I'm comfortable\nT:\tokay okay so you smoked how long\nC:\twell 35 my first time I smoked was a I was 12 years old it progressed as I got through high school and I've been a regular smoker since about the age of 17\nT:\tokay so about half your life you've been a regular smoker\nC:\tyep\nT:\tokay about how much you did\nC:\twell oh it's kind of buried over that span of time but I'd say right now I'm about about half a pack a day\nT:\tokay okay the most important thing I mean I've got slides will and statistics and all kinds of scary things I can say but the most important thing from my perspective is what your thoughts are about your smoking where you at with being a cigarette smoker\nC:\twell I am aware that it's it does have adverse health effects and down the road I perceive me at making a change in my behavior and and knowing that the health consequences associated with with smoking but that day is not today I don't feel like I really use you know when it started off as I mentioned as a teen it was more of a social thing\nT:\tsure\nC:\tand acceptance my friends were doing it I got to college I was open and open to more people who were were smokers as well and it seemed to be more accepted and I've just been you know continued that uses of as an adult\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know it's it's for me it's now become much more of a habit and just a routine as much it is is the I feel like the the nicotine in the effects of the the cigarette itself it's very much part of my daily routine this is part of your life this is what you do\nT:\tyeah and you know I know it's it's you know the cost and have gotten increase in over the last few years with with the cigarettes but uh but like I said at this point in time in my life I have a trouble seeing myself quit I'm a little bit concerned about you know I've had friends who tried to quit as well some successful some haven't been as successful ones that you know have quit they've noticed they've gained a lot of weight and and that's kind of concerns me in my age ranges what kind okay so you're doing a lot of good thinking well what what I heard you say and clearly you're a guy who sought through some things about your health what I heard you say smoking has some negative consequences and I don't want those things to happen but today's not the day I'm not gonna sign up and say today all all quit cold-turkey right you know appreciate that I would like to know will more about what you know about potential negative consequences when you think about what happens to smokers even half a pack a day what consequences are we concerned about\nC:\twell my grandfather had had emphysema\nT:\tchirp\nC:\twhich is you know a direct cause of his smoking non-filter cigarettes for 35 plus years\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tthat concerns me\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know shortness of breath I noticed you know I still try to do some limited and exercise and and sometimes it's very labor intensive for me when I'm exercising that's a concern you know the health of my family my wife you know being exposed to secondhand smoke is mostly concern you know we're looking at starting a family soon and and I know that behavior will need to change when when that when that time comes but I guess you know in terms of other health concerns you know you know the more unpleasant ones the the complaints from the family members about the smell of me\nT:\tyeah yeah it's our that the the social pressure is a rough\nC:\tyou know and now you know I with with different places and businesses outlawing you know smoking in side restaurants and bars around our area it's become much more of a challenge maybe publicly\nT:\tso these real big health problems some of which your grandpa has emphysema certainly lung cancer another risk that people take and then you look at what's going on in your own health already a little short of breath sometimes not having the lung capacity that you'd like to have social pressure exposing your wife you know I I wish I could say that's not a word but I think you're doing some good thinking I do think part of why all this hassle about smoking publicly has happened is because if your wife's exposed certainly it's the two of you had children if your children were exposed there are some real health consequences to people who are around you when you're smoking and already some some sense of some symptoms you've had with so it's you're breathing all right are there any other you mentioned breathing and people's negative reactions your fear for your wife's health are there any other things that I should understand that you don't like about being a smoker other concerns\nC:\tyou know uh I mean I guess it's in terms of my health you know the my teeth the yellowness of that the whitening of teeth and the appearance that I have you know the I guess there's one thing on the surface that's of concern you know really I think that the respiratory issues that we talked about you know\nT:\tsure\nC:\tthe lung cancer those were pretty much my primary big ones you're not concerned with but you know the the routine that I have with the smoking is it's so ingrained in my lifestyle that it's just really hard for me to fathom being of stopping\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know I've not really made a strong effort in the past to to quit you know if I've sampled some of the nicotine gum from friends who've tried it\nT:\tright\nC:\tand didn't care for that it was found it you know not an equal replacement for the real thing\nT:\tyeah yeah\nC:\tand I think that's kind of worrying\nT:\tokay so so when you weigh things you just say man I'm concerned about weight gain this trick I know the gum didn't seem so great what else do you know we'll about sort of small steps people could take who don't want to get emphysema or lung cancer or have this thing progressed are there any small step you're telling me you're not really quit cold-turkey\nC:\twell I think I mentioned in the beginning when we were talking at you know the the volume of cigarettes that smoke is kind of varied over the years there was a time in my early 20s where I was pushing close to a pack a day including trying to reduce the amount great is is one I guess more tangible a realistic option and in terms to losing it\nT:\tabsolutely\nC:\trather than cold turkey although I've kind of heard mixed messages that maybe cold turkey is the best way to go or not so I'm not really clear on what would be the best strategy to apply\nT:\twell you've taken an important step will one of the first things I say to people who say I can't stop cold turkey is could you consider cutting back that's a huge step that is significant it's not perfect but I'm not in the business of perfect patience will I'm in the business of people taking small steps and this is this is a big one and I want to congratulate you I do know some things about other steps will and and even it sounds like quit cold-turkey isn't a step today but I do know some other options some other options to lay out potentially would it be ok if you and I talked about those other options that you could just file away for when you're ready\nC:\tsure I'm always open to some suggestions and advice when it comes to this absolutely\nT:\tgreat\n",
  "C:\tI'm feeling very stressed out lately a lot of tension couldn't tell me more about that I just feel like nothing I do is good enough I work really hard I try really hard but I'm still having a really hard time\nT:\tso what I hear you saying is that you're feeling really stressed and kind of stretched out too thin\nC:\tI am stretched too thin I'm trying so hard but I can't live up to my dad's expectations I really love him but it doesn't feel right or what it should be like my friend's parents support them\nT:\tand what do you wish things would be like\nC:\tI like to have more free time I have lots of friends and they get to relax and hang out after school and I don't get to do any of those things I like to do that or spend time with my boyfriend my dad has always pushed sports if it's not volleyball it's another sport and I just want to make him happy\nT:\tthat sounds exhausting so it sounds like you're feeling this contradiction of pleasing your dad and meeting his expectations but you also want to enjoy yourself and be young is that right\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso that must be really frightening to be so confused about your dad's expectations and I also imagine you feel pretty frustrated with them yeah I am frustrated with them\nC:\tif I don't please him it makes me feel like I'm not good enough\nT:\twhat do you think your dad wants you to be like\nC:\twell he wants me to be in really good shape make the best of grades graduate with honors so I can get into a really great school and I know he just wants the best for me and I want to make him happy\nT:\tI can really hear you really love your that don't you\nC:\tyeah which is why not living up to his standards is so hard and\nT:\tso it's this feeling that only a part of you is acceptable and that doesn't leave much room for you to be human does it\nC:\tno it's like he wants me to be perfect perfect like those women in the magazines\nT:\tyeah and if his love for you is based on picture what's the good at that\nC:\tyou're right it is no good I can't ever be good enough for him I can't ever live up to his expectations and we have this college visit coming up I feel like college is too far away is too far to the future I feel like it's too much pressure and I'm not even sure if that's where I want to go to school I could visit at any point but it's this weekend my boyfriend was going to take me to a concert that all my friends are going to I want to enjoy my life not worry about the future my dad said we had to go now even though he knows about the concert this weekend what should I do it's not where I want to go anyway but I can't tell my dad I could never tell him that's not where I want to go I want to be a kid I want to enjoy my life I just don't think it's fair why do I always have to live up to what he wants me to do what should I do should I tell my dad I don't want to go\nT:\tso this is the conflict it's really hard for me because I want to give you an answer and I really wish that I could give you the answer you want I really mean that\nC:\tbut that's why I'm going to therapy I thought you were supposed to tell me what to do\nT:\twell I don't mean to be evasive about this but I just I want to know what do you think you should do in this situation\nC:\tI don't know why can't I just be like a normal person and tell him I don't want to go why do I tell him things I really don't mean\nT:\tand so I catch that the real deep puzzle is you feel this what should I do sometimes it's sad for me to notice how hard you are on yourself about yourself and I really appreciate you sharing this with me well\nC:\tyeah I'm hard on myself because I need to be but I hate how I always have to live up to such high standards\nT:\tand so the thing that comes to mind is me asking what do you wish I would say to you\nC:\tI wish you would tell me what to do I feel like there's a part of me that really wants to please my dad but in order to please him I don't feel like I can be myself there's just a part of me that feels lost and unsure of myself\nT:\tyeah I really hear that and to me at the same time you don't sound too uncertain\nC:\toh really\nT:\tyeah judging by the tone your voice it sounds like the thought of doing what your dad wants you to do is more uncomfortable than it is for you to actually tell him how you feel\nC:\tI just wish you would listen that he wanted to know how I feel he just wants me to be the perfect daughter but he doesn't even know the real me\nT:\tand so you sort of feel this I want my dad to like me for who I am\nC:\tyeah I'm not the straight a size zero perfect girl and I can never be good enough I can never be smart enough or skinny enough and\nT:\twhen I think I'm hearing you say is that you'd like to feel accepted for your dad\nC:\tyeah that's what I want how can I do that do you think I should say something to him\nT:\twell I feel like this is a really private thing that I couldn't answer for you but I'll definitely try to help you come to your own answer\nC:\tit doesn't matter how much I want him to accept me you wouldn't like the real me I could never live up to his expectations the thought of even saying anything is terrifying because I know he would be so disappointed would it even be worth it to say something to him\nT:\tI'm really not sure it's an awfully risky thing to live and you'd be taking a chance with your relationship with him and you'd also be taking a chance with yourself\nC:\tyeah it really is risky I'm never in control of anything sometimes I feel like the only thing I have control over is\nT:\tthat sounds really upsetting I think what I'm hearing you say is that by controlling food is the only way that you feel it you can make a choice for yourself\nC:\teven just talking about it right now is making me really tense because it's making me think of everything I ate today counting the calories is one of the only things that makes me feel better because it's something I can control\nT:\tso you're feeling anxious at the moment and like your only relief is in controlling what you eat\nC:\tI guess that's the only thing my dad can't control that it's just mine I don't think that's right I wish I didn't have to be so hard on myself and I could eat like everybody else does\nT:\tso it's quite clear that the problem isn't just with your dad or your relationship with him but it's also at you as well and in this question of how can I accept myself\n",
  "T:\thi Alex my name is Tony I'll be your nurse for today how are you doing\nC:\tI'm okay I guess just waiting for the stitches to come out it would be nice\nT:\tokay tell me a little bit more about this firefight\nC:\tokay story time you rate this so proud my girls having a fantastic time looking off on fleek and ish and then this girl like she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room it gives me this kind of it come on like this and then she comes up to me she bumps into me she spills my drink and she comes up and then she's like there man so I'm like excuse me so obviously I pushed her she pushed me kind of thing and yeah one thing led to another all right so it's a blur from that point on but all I know is that cops showed up I'm here and I have this to deal with fantastic great\nT:\tokay from what I'm getting here is you were intoxicated at that point in time and then you had a confrontation with this girl which led to the bar fight and\nC:\tI was more than toxic it Oh smash oh you should have seen it but like this type of thing doesn't happen often so I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some AAA because yo I'm not an alcoholic\nT:\tokay so it seems that you can't offend that they feel offended you refer to me\nC:\tyeah I'm not an alcoholic no I'm\nT:\tokay because it labels you guys mom\nC:\tyeah exactly\nT:\tover yeah all right of all we do have some time right now if it's okay with you I wonder if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits\nC:\tyeah sure no\nT:\tI do you what is drinking you for you would have\nC:\tyeah well you know being 25 that's what we do like we get together we'd hang out we get a couple of drinks it's me and my girls we do this all the time and I love this it breaks the ice when we go socializing so meet new people kind of thing you know girlfriends circle it's it's fantastic and it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are so stressful is I need this you know so I mean yeah but just so you know I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that\nT:\tokay so to me this is our drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends is your way to socialize and it breaks that I guess right it helps you socialize and you know I'm I also wanted to say that experience I was responsible of you to be drinking and not driving\nC:\tthank you\nT:\thow does it affected your life\nC:\twho has it well I mean now that this happens I do have it because of that bar fight and he's gonna be disappointed so I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry it's been great fantastic but he says that when I drink it's like I'm not myself it's like somebody has never met before and obviously you can imagine the arguments the fights and oh my god all that stress it's just I love him so much but you know but it does stress and that's like I don't forget to make it it it's just\nT:\tso for my understanding drinking it helps you socialize his friends it relaxes you it's you know here we have just you know it breaks that ice for you on the other hand it's causing that a lot of arguments of do you and your significant other Henry\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand it's causing a lot that that all those arguments are completed you a lot of stress in your relationship this manager\nC:\tyeah I mean we're engaged you look pretty this is well I don't like you put it that way I mean I'm worried because what's he gonna think of me later on the link once again I tell our children all your mom is an alcoholic she drank this and they go into fight I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way but at the same time I mean I don't want to quit cold-turkey I mean you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it but I love him so much I mean I would do anything for him and he's gonna be so he didn't even say I don't know how can I face him\nT:\tthis seems like a little Brady lucky died to have someone who loved him that much\nC:\tmmm boy seriously he's not gonna find anybody that loves him as much as I do trust me on that it's not gonna happen\nT:\tso what I'm getting here right now is that if you just want to quit\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyeah and it's just partly because um but this alcohol is the leading to the arguments with Henry and it's necessary relationship\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI noticed over a year there and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it eh like what's one shift of light on that\nC:\tit's a place or alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said I'm not an alcoholic\nT:\tmm-hmm well you're right there for multiple walks of life and they share their drinking stories and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey if you can so prayer together\nC:\tokay\nT:\tI don't even want to join eight at this point in time\nC:\tokay\nT:\tmom's but hypothetically speaking would you ever consider joining it\nC:\tif this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it\nT:\tmm-hmm okay well on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm 10 mean like for sure and 1 being not really sure about it at all what would you say where you are on the scale with 20 an 80-acre know that you\nC:\tput it that way and everything I told you I would say 6 yeah\nT:\twhy would you say sticks instead of say that's really I mean you're really adamant about not doing anything\nC:\twell it's all about it's all about Henry at the end of the day it's it matters to me if I want to keep disengagement and I will do anything for that man so of course this is what I have to do this to do this is him live including his relationship with me and it's so much more important to me than drunk in a bar I'll tell him that\nT:\tyeah so right now we're sitting at a six what needs to happen stated maybe we can jump that to an eight or nine\nC:\tum you know like flexible hours maybe if that isn't even an option um also maybe there's maybe if there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby my house I'll be great so off to waste gas its expense I already go to work and it's far anyway and um like I guess I guess it has to do with attitude as well I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look and my drinking habits and all of that so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe you know I don't want to be judged not labeled\nT:\tyeah all of these are like really understand aborning it's just of course you want something I mean you need to be close to use you don't have to commute so far and\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twe all have very busy schedules\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthe fish is very busy sniffle and Emily makes sense and of course the environment I mean

  "T:\twell Jessica once we tell me what brings you here today\nC:\tand I've just been feeling really unhappy lately firstly\nT:\tyou can feel happy\nC:\tyeah I just my family I just been really upset with my husband and I'm kind of curious are starting to think about it may be leaving him might be something I need to do\nT:\twith your husband\nC:\tyeah and I mean um a one hand I know that that's where i'm wanting to go possibly but on the other hand i'm wanting to stay so I'm kind of torn between if that's where i go with it\nT:\tso you feel torn stuck between decisions about\nC:\tyeah and it's just I don't know what which way I need to go right now ok so it's Rick me feel like you need to leave your husband well lately hey jess has a good helping me or parenting our son's one a damn cat scratch fever and so we've been having to make a lot of visits to the emergency room and he has not been going with me to these visits and he also has not they have been watching the other son Wong going to the hospital and it's just been adding a lot of stress on me\nT:\tso sometimes you're stressed because your son's how's his health issues\nC:\tsome sporting a nice pen somebody other than providing nothing yeah and I mean it's just been very stressful life I just I want him to be the father figure you know one him I wanted to be a partnership in handling our children but he just I've told you this a hundred times and he's just not listening to me like we're at the hospital I he was just like i'll be there and then he never showed up and I mean I don't want that but on the other hand I don't want I really don't believe him neither so I'm kind of stuck on what I need to do you I don't know what the best decision is so we're here is like the other idea of my vonage of being a partnership from supporting in advance and he's not very  same time you understand yeah yeah it's I want to stay with him for his relationship with my son's I don't want to take I'm scared if I take their father under their life you know they may not have a relationship with them anymore and I don't want to hurt that\nT:\tokay sounds like email about it sometime relationship with his father you feel is 50 leaving the relationship will be damaged it someone\nC:\tyeah he's I mean he's not he isn't it being the best parent right now for as far as a partner but I know he cares about them and I know that you know my son's look up to them very much so what would be the worst case so you want to for Charm School but it would hurt their relationship that he might decide that he doesn't to be a quarter lessons life at all and then I taken their father away from you you know that's what I feel like at least that that would hurt film he also very normal fears about messing up the family\nT:\tmm-hmm separating your kids\nC:\tyeah that's something that I worry about for the rest of course\nT:\tif you were to leave them\nC:\twell that he was still continued have a relationship with employees but I would be able to find happiness because I might be right extremely happy and I don't see him changing in the future because this is the gone off a few years and I'm talking about it and he's just very he's not going to change right now and so I would the best case scenario would be that I would be able to find someone later or finding myself to be happy but you know I'm just not it's bringing me down happiness is a party but as well as you your son's happiness\nT:\tyeah and said I mean that's what I'm Stefan is that do I stay with him and even though I'm unhappy and even though he's not being emotionally supportive for me so that he could have that relationship with my son or do I leave him and possibly hurt their relationship but by a find better support for myself\nC:\tso if you have some someone feels about keeping your family together what's coming happen\nT:\tyeah maybe this up\nC:\tokay your feelings\nT:\tyeah and he's um he's hidden danone considering leaving him I mean I started it in the past but he just always ignored it and just blow it all I child leaving him before but I never was able to do it for more than a couple of days hey this is my hair I mean or like with the parenting thing I want to get there I'll me get better but it never happens so what's up a lot of fun\nC:\tbut you have to see this behavior\nT:\tyeah and so that's why it because they give you more depressed is that I'm just stuck and I don't I don't know what to do instead become go stalking approach\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tI mean it's just I'm crying all the time I'm all happy i'm feeling so overwhelmed with everything i'm having to do and i'm getting a lot of stress for my parents because they're having to help out a lot because he's slacking they build that since I married that he should be helping me financially it should be helping me words against and that she's not happening\nC:\tstressful your family also seems to have you feel things should be supporting these one\nT:\tyeah it's just it's causing a hard the conflict in my life and I just never know it she's making me really happy sounds back around doing nothing everyone i am basically doing the same routine besides going to take my son to all the doctor visits and hospital visits I have no friends because I don't have any time to myself because I'm basically a single parent even if someone else's in the household I I'm not I don't have anything to do outside of the house and I hard time\nC:\tyou do anything I saw the house sounds like\nT:\tyeah yeah I know I'm the annoying if we weren't together my family would be more helpful you know they even offer me any support if I just leave you know that I could live a diff and that would help me with the boys but for now you know they're kind of saying it as he is to step up since he's the one I'm living with it is just not happening and I'm always stressed as well about money because he's he's not providing adequate finances for our family there's times where hundreds and hundreds dollars go missing him off them here's no idea where it's gone too and that's very stressful so all so much for the money\nC:\tsorry yeah I mean I'm just be sure you're happy about the situation but I don't want to make the wrong decision and hurt our children either so what would be your first step just like a better point if you wanted to to link them\nT:\tso you know um I guess to figure out where i'm going to say my parents had offered her place i have a couple friends who offered a lot of jobs so i would have to stay with somebody else\nC:\tdon't you feel about making their stuff\nT:\tI would I mean right now I'm I feel like I'm not ready to do that to take that except I feel like I'm scary at first steps best food we've been comfortable with yeah and I don't want to have to explain to a child you know why mommy her mommy both boys are moving to make plays\nC:\tso we've got a lot of thoughts in your head the buildings in Smith just give her stuff to have done people want to tell you something that you weren't even husband about it\nT:\tyeah yeah and i don't mean I values the love moments into I don't want to it makes me sad to think that I feel me more like you know like my husband anymore if I do that ok you may not we may not be able to work it out if I go through you know how am I actually and that's splitting up so it's scary soon over i watch mr. bone switch your family yeah and it's um it's worrisome picking their steps so I'm so far the probe\nC:\tthe Miller one support from your husband which are not getting that but Gail may not look at that at the same time do you want to stand it has a family and even if the support is not much new happen it's much better than what you feel not again if you what I mean\nT:\tyeah yeah I'm just really stuck between the two yarders don't know where I'm going to go from here I'm really telling martin's right now but I know that I really don't be sad\n",
  "T:\tso I noticed on your diary car that you have that you did cut\nC:\tyup\nT:\tokay so let's talk about that a little bit when what day did that happen on\nC:\tTuesday\nT:\tTuesday okay so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut\nC:\twhere I usually always am at school\nT:\tthat's well\nC:\tI was on my Walker and that stupid girl\nT:\twhat was going on at your locker\nC:\tMelanie was talking about Tim my Tim my boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted a puncher so bad\nT:\tokay see you were standing at your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear\nC:\tyeah she was talking about him and he had he didn't text me the night before so who knows what's going on\nT:\twhat were you feeling right then\nC:\tso angry so angry\nT:\ton a scale of one to ten how angry would you say you were\nC:\tlike a nine\nT:\tpretty angry then\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhat did you do like then you're at your locker what's the next thing you did after you heard it the\nC:\tnext thing I did I slammed my locker and I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her or poncho\nT:\tso I know that the gym is usually the place where he cut because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym where did you decide to cut because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody so there must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut\nC:\tI think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her I'm gonna get in trouble I'm gonna go cut\nT:\tokay so that was when you decided to cut and you went down to the gym\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tand what happened when you got there\nC:\twell nobody was there because gym class isn't in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym so I went behind the bleachers\nT:\twhat did you use to cut\nC:\tthe pencil that I have always used\nT:\tto the same pencil as usual\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthe one with the the metal tip\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of\nC:\tyeah I know it's just it's it's my favorite pencil I I use it for school and I just it's my favorite pencil\nT:\tokay so you still had the pencil you got under the bleachers you say you were feeling angry still are you still on the scale of one to ten where were you when you got under the bleachers\nC:\tI was still let like I was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I I knew I was going to cut\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso it like came down a little bit\nT:\twhat were you thinking at that point\nC:\twell I thought couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly\nT:\tso you have your pencil where did you cut\nC:\ton my\nT:\tleg how many times\nC:\tthree\nT:\thow deep did you cut where it was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid did you need more than a band-aid\nC:\tno I mean I guess I could have used a band-aid but I mean whatever\nT:\tbut it wasn't so deep that you needed something more\nC:\tno\nT:\tokay right after you cut where were you on the scale of one to ten with your feeling with your anger like a\nC:\t3\nT:\t3 what were you thinking right afterwards\nC:\tthat felt good I feel better and I'm going to have to talk to Michelle about this\nT:\tdid that feeling last you for the rest of the day they're feeling better um yeah for the most part yeah did\nC:\tokay so that's what happened right afterwards\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tlater in the day what were you thinking about the cutting well\nT:\tI kind of forgot about it okay but then I just started thinking about it again right before bad and just feeling really guilty that I cut because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you and I just I mean I the night time I just I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like I mean you know it's usually a pretty hard time\nC:\tI know net is a really difficult time for you\nT:\tit is everything seems worse at night\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso you were thinking back it up back on it then and you were feeling guilty\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tsounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon\nC:\tno not always seems to happen\nT:\tsounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last\nC:\tyeah I guess so\nT:\tI know you've also been working on doing less cutting\nC:\tI've been doing pretty good\nT:\tyou have you've been working really hard I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings\nC:\tyeah maybe I mean those guilty feelings really suck\nT:\tokay so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your locker what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim\nC:\tyeah because she's stupid\nT:\tokay it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day you said he hadn't called he hadn't been texting as much and that was on your mind\nC:\tyeah that's right\nT:\tso I'm wondering if at that point if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting\nC:\tokay\nT:\tthat'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit\nC:\tit's not going to bring it down all the way to a three though I'll tell you that much\nT:\tit might not but it'll bring it down a little bit maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more\nC:\talright\nT:\tmaybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later you won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back\nC:\talright\nT:\tso the first thing is that pencil it sounds like it's comforting to have it\nC:\tyeah it is\nT:\tit also sounds like it's tempting what do you think about that\nC:\tI mean only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting I'm\nT:\thaving that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things and you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less\nC:\tyeah I am\nT:\tsounds like that pencil standing in your way\nC:\tyeah maybe\nT:\twhat do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time choosing a different favorite pencil but maybe you can't cut with\nC:\tI mean maybe only only if it's can be like a really cool pencil\nT:\tthat way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you that'll make it easier to try the two things\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay what do you think our first thing should be what do you think you can try you just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry what can you do in that moment\nC:\twhat I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on\nT:\tdo you have your headphones with you at school\nC:\tyeah they they actually they let me keep them on in school\nT:\tis that something you'd be willing to try next time\nC:\tI think so there's a there's a few songs that usually help me so I think so\nT:\tokay that sounds like a good one to try so we have headphones I need to come up with one more what do you think you'd like to try\nC:\twell I really like my teacher mrs. en so she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk and her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker in the same hallway so I guess I could talk to her\nT:\tthat sounds like a good option so that's our goal is to keep pushing cutting further down the list and to keep adding things that you're going to try first and you're right that the first thing you try might not bring you all the way down to a two or of three but it might bring you down a little bit and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more so you have to be willing to try a few things can you do that\nC:\tI can but I really want like a cooler pencil though like like a cooler pencil so I don't know maybe maybe we could go look for a pencil together\nT:\tI think that's a good idea\nC:\tokay I'd like that\nT:\tokay thank you for answering all my questions on this you did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy\nC:\tyeah you're welcome\nT:\tlet's go look for that pencil\n",
  "T:\tlook Carl how are you doing today\nC:\toh good good area I'm doing well thanks for asking last week you were talking in therapy\nT:\tyeah I mean and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week but a joke I was telling you about Jill my coworker and you know she was kind of bothering me in the past couple weeks but really this this past week was like the worst right so she's not doing her paperwork and the thing is is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports so if she doesn't have hers I can't do mine and then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do their it's a mess the whole thing's a mess and it's just it's annoying me\nC:\tso her work slowdown would not be efficient work is affecting your work productivity\nT:\tyeah yeah it definitely is and it it's one of those things that like you know has it gives me a bad a bad evaluation you know like it if I'm not eating my stuff in in time then it reflects negatively on me you know and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level you know and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time so she doesn't then I don't then the next person and so forth\nC:\tand it makes it seem like you're not doing your job\nT:\tright yeah and my boss doesn't like it my boss's boss doesn't like it so forth you know and I try to explain to them you know she's the problem but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like here's what's happening or it just somehow it doesn't come out\nC:\tyou don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation\nT:\tyeah and that's pretty annoying too because you know it's one thing if people get mad at me but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to but it's another thing for them to get me into me not realizing my fault you know\nC:\tyou have an explanation for why the works that get done\nT:\tyeah I did I do that's the thing but I can't always get it out you know I can't always tell the person that's has the complain about and yeah I mean I tried talking to my my boss and I tried talking other people too you know but really hasn't gotten anywhere\nC:\tso you're feeling stuck with this whole thing\nT:\tyeah yeah I mean I talked to Jill a little bit about it too you know and I tried to ask I tried kind of gently reminding her you know like such-and-such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock yeah I didn't want to be real abrasive you know but I I tried to remind\nC:\tit was a polite approach\nT:\tyeah yeah and it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening\nC:\tyour attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you wanted\nT:\tno it really hasn't and and that's just I feel like I've tried everything that I could try you know and even like I came home and I was talking to a friend about it and I was trying to think of other solutions right you know I was trying to think like what else I could do what else I could say who else I could talk to things like that you know and I mean my friend you know he was listening in staffing had some good suggestions but it he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company so like I got nothing\nC:\tyou're not getting help you need for this\nT:\tyeah not at all feeling pretty lost with it and then I wish it was just like a clearer way to do things like this is what you should do now and I don't see anything\nC:\tsome sort of clear plan\nT:\tyeah yeah but I yeah I don't I don't see a way to go about it I mean I so I right so this is the way I lay down my mind I tried talking to the people above me mm-hmm didn't work out the way I thought it would I tried talking to the people below me so to speak just lower on the before me in the process that's what I mean and that didn't work out which it's just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work so like there's nowhere else I could turn\nC:\tthe options are exhausted\nT:\tyeah that's what it seems like to me\nC:\tand this is frustrating for you yeah it is and I've been trying to Rack my brain you know like what else could I do you know like maybe if I could maybe if there was like a committee or something that I could go to you know and be like well this person's not doing what they're supposed to be different but there's not a committee like that or even if there was like a person you know like a resolution person or whatever but there's there's nobody like that\nT:\tthere's no other Avenue\nC:\tthat's what it seems like to me yeah and you knows I'm even trying to think like I don't know should I write a letter to somebody maybe but I don't even know who or what\nT:\tyou've thought about a letter but who would you send it to\nC:\tyeah or like just something else that I could I can do instead of going to this person though that person that didn't work could I could I call us somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that but I mean there's there's HR people but that's I I can't really see where they could come in I don't know how Human Resources could deal with something like that\nT:\tyou don't view them as a potential solution\nC:\twonder me if there's like a but there's I mean I'm thinking now that there's got to be something or somebody or somewhere that I could put in like almost like a complaint or something like something's out of my hands and I don't know what to do about it look there's got to be something and now that I'm saying this I'm thinking that there's got to be\nT:\tsome other resource you haven't tried yet\nC:\tyeah yeah and I mean now I'm trying to think back to my training you know initially you know what I think now that I'm now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about it a little bit differently about it I'm thinking that there's like man I forget what they call it now but maybe like a complaint but it's not the right word but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something and I think if I remember correctly those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting which we have like every other week\nT:\tthey're discussed at this regular meeting\nC:\tyeah and I'm I'm thinking now I mean nobody really uses it but I'm thinking like maybe that's an avenue that I can use you know and like maybe that'll get brought up and maybe that's something that then might actually work\nT:\tthis could be another option for you\nC:\tyeah it could be and then if it does work it'll get thrown and rather if they do read it it'll get brought up at the staff meeting where everybody's at my boss my boss's boss Jill everybody's there and maybe that's a way for it to come to everybody's attention that deadlines being missed affect other people in ways that you don't really know about\nT:\tso everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you\nC:\tmaybe yeah I think that's I mean that's gotta be the way to do it and maybe that's the best way ever I really think yeah I mean after saying all that after going through that I really think that that's probably the best way to do it and if it if it doesn't and I guess I could find another way but I really think that's the best way to do it\nT:\tyou feel as though you found an option here\nC:\tyeah yeah and even if that doesn't work then it'll be brought up and maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it and maybe he'll understand really where I'm coming from but this will at least be a start to something you know how to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff\nT:\tyou are frustrated with all this\nC:\tyeah but maybe maybe after I do that you know put in the complaint or suggestion\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tmaybe I won't be as frustrated I'm gonna feel a little bit less frustrated now even thinking if there is another opportunity\nT:\tit feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\twell this might be a good place to wrap this session up that feels like the right move for you\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand well schedule so I see you next week and we can pick up from there\nC:\tsounds good\nT:\tall right cool thanks Carl\nC:\tthank you\n",
  "T:\tyes there it goes okay hi I'm Sheila I'll be your pharmacist today um first can you describe by your name and birth date\nC:\tum my name is carb and my I am 57 years old\nT:\tokay that's good enough I just wanna make sure I have the right person and so I have three things for you today is that when you're expressing\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay I just wanted to take a minute and go through these with you all right okay great I was like - these are results for you we have the Lance's insulin which is your long-acting insulin and then we have the metformin catalyst cannot look like what you've been picking\nC:\tyes that's women taking\nT:\tokay great and so I'm how do you be using these\nC:\tuh my metformin I take twice a day and then the insulin I just take in the evening\nT:\tokay great and then on this it says 48 units are you still taking that much or\nC:\tyes for me\nT:\tokay and have you noticed any side effects or any problems with these but I can help you in\nC:\tno the doctor says my diabetes isn't under control\nT:\tokay all right well it looks like they decided to add another influence and so what this is is novalog which is also called a smart insulin looks like um this one is one that you're gonna actually I should rephrase that and what did your how did your doctor tell you to take this\nC:\tI guess I have to take that on before I eat carbohydrates\nT:\tright okay great and um why did your doctor amasses\nC:\tum because my diabetes is on control teas done\nT:\talright okay great so um you're right you're going to use this with meals and you're going to actually try to get before you eat so that may be a little bit difficult because you're going to estimate how much carbohydrate you're going to eat before you actually eat it so it might be a little dicey at first um try to help you with that um what did your doctor tell you to expect with the medication\nC:\tum that the same thing that you said I'll have to do a certain amount of units for each amount a card\nT:\tokay now with insulin there's some things that we'd like to that sometimes can be a problem too like hypoglycemia have you experience animal\nC:\tyeah I have a little bit\nT:\tokay how have you been managed genius\nC:\tuh I eat like soda or drink soda sorry or like glucose tablets\nT:\toh okay great and usually keep something on you then okay it's going to be even more important now that you're going to be doing it so basically you're going to start with the one unit for 15 grams of carbohydrate and that might be a little bit abstract for you so I don't know if you've ever done carb counting before so I got you some information um this is just a general like nutrition facts thing that you would see on a food label\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso they make it really easy for you guys it just says right here a total carbohydrate so this is per serving though so I wanted to draw your attention to the top where it says it's serving size is you might have to do a little bit math here like on this one a serving size is one ounce but there's four servings in there bad\nC:\toh\nT:\tif you ate the whole bag you would have to multiply this by 4\nC:\tso that'll be four carbs rather than one\nT:\tumm right for a unit right because this is almost 15 or\nC:\t4 units\nT:\tright so you would use for a units of insulin to cover a full bag of it so that's how you do the math\nC:\tokay\nT:\tnow unfortunately this is more of a general average and since you're just starting on it it's probably not going to be realistic so what you're going to want to do is monitor this monitor your blood sugar and any type of like thing you can sense that you have when you first start this is um mainly a really like a range and some people leave one unit for like 9 grams and cards and some people need one unit for like 30 grams of carbs so it's really going to be dependent on how sensitive you are to insulin\nC:\tso I might have to go up\nT:\tyeah you might have to go up or down just depending on how you react so what I would suggest is keeping like a log with you I don't know if you're logging your blood sugar reading and like a paper log or if you're just keeping it in your letter\nC:\tin my meter yeah\nT:\tyeah it might be good idea to have like a moment of madness you just when you get started so you can kind of figure out exactly how many units you need per amount of carbs just as far as what you respond to yeah\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou know this is just another little thing about when you first start getting used to counting carbohydrates just grant information for you so um I know you've been on the Lantis and it's an injectable how have you been doing the injection\nC:\tum just in my belly that's that area punching the pan now are you using like the same area on your abdomen or do you kind of use different sauce I rotate it between each side\nT:\tokay now that we're adding another influence you're going to be adding three more injections a day perhaps so I gave you a little chart here there are other places on your body that you can inject other than your abdomen so it might be a good idea because you really do want to rotate by Senora tation okay um so you're pretty familiar with how to use a syringe then\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay you have a sharps container at home to secure the needles great okay so just to refresh they're only going to be using a couple of units at a time with this so I'm each each mark on here is a one unit and it goes up to 50 so pretty easy at least it's not done by twos or anything\nC:\tright\nT:\tokay um so we've gone over a lot of information and just to make sure I didn't leave anything out we've come through a lot of stuff here um can you just tell me how you're going to use these\nC:\tokay yeah um well my old medications I'm going to continue taking so I'm going to take the metformin twice a day and the nighttime insulin at night and then with the new one I'm going to take one unit for 15 grams of carbohydrates but rotate site so that I don't get any atrophy and then I'm going I think it's a good idea to keep that logbook and monitor my route post levels in case the doctor will need to adjust the dose of that\nT:\tI think it's actually great and yeah I just wanted to maybe ask another question about um you know what kind of exercise habits we have or how is your blood pressure been I noticed that as far as what information I have it was a little high which is something it concerns us with diet medication so I would have even\nC:\tum well I have the back pain so I can't exercise that much and lately I just haven't been going to the nutritionist as often as I should\nT:\tokay what kind of barriers are standing in the way of that\nC:\tmy job I'm a principal I'm pretty busy this time of year\nT:\tokay um as far as your back pain and what is the root cause of your family you know if it's like something that maybe a chiropractor or massage might help there's the low impact exercise maybe a hope it for you I don't know maybe you can bring it up your doctor or two or Long's we're gonna be getting on something like just walking or like a stationary bike or even swimming if any of those are things that you can implement it'd be a really good improvement come and anyone needs much insulin -\nC:\toh okay\nT:\tone other quick little thing is that um so insulin and your amount of exercising and activity kind of go hand-in-hand so if you start to exercise more all of a sudden you may need less insulin so once you get started on this and you know how much you're going to use per how many carbs it may change with you come around which is a good thing yeah but just keep in mind because you may have more hypoglycemic events if you don't alter\nC:\tit watch it but maybe I won't have to use as much\nT:\tyeah exactly so what other questions you have for me\nC:\tum I just had one question I don't know if you'd answer this or the doctor but my eyesight oh if I get this if I use the insulin and get better control well my eyesight get better or shot getting is worse\nT:\tum it should hopefully stay blind not get any worse I'm not sure if it will repair at all I don't think it will but it's best to stop it now you know I stopped their progression so the better control you have the better it should be as far as not getting worse but I've definitely something it's gonna be important - especially your occupation so so yeah getting under control - great a great thing\nC:\tokay thank you\nT:\tall right well thank you very much and give me a call if anything comes up I have some more information for you here which is very much just what we've gone over but that we can write all right\nC:\tthanks\n",
  "T:\tall right before our are you today\nC:\tI'm good how are you\nT:\tI'm pretty good sons outshining makes me happy\nC:\tdefinitely very warm\nT:\tthinking that wait so why are you here today it'll be a any specific reason sir\nC:\tOh my doctor said I had type 2 diabetes so I don't really want to go on medication so\nT:\toh that's actually very common today with medications doing it by a natural healthy lifestyle so she said you have text red beans did she tell you anything about that or I will level are we right now with the understanding of what type 2 diabetes is\nC:\twell I know I had something to do with the insulin but she didn't really understand\nT:\twell I'm here for you so what type 2 diabetes is is in your body that working called your pancreas secretes this insulin excrete hormone called insulin and what the insulin does is takes up the glucose that's in your blood it brings it into yourselves that they use for energy and in your case your body is still producing insulin but it's just not either producing enough or it's having trouble getting it into the cells for various reasons or you're producing it it's just not working your body loses insulin resistant right now so do you know why your cells need the glucose\nC:\terr\nT:\tyes exactly it's due form of energy and your brain needs a minimum level of glucose to function along with all your other organs so by not getting that insulin or by not getting the glucose into yourselves there's some sense there's starving going to ketoacidosis a lot of complications can happen with that so it's very important to maintain blood glucose and control your Sugar's with a type 2 diabetes\nC:\tso that's why I've been so tired recently\nT:\tyes that's a very good cause of it so yeah that's perfect so well let's talk about your daily routine in your diet and see how that plays into it right now so what do you do on a normal day or what times would she be okay\nC:\twell usually I just start breakfast eggs bacon\nT:\tokay\nC:\tthat for lunch they'll usually say like some deli meat bread\nT:\thybrid wait girl in purple and\nC:\tthen for dinner on like pasta or some kind of poultry\nT:\tokay so have you ever considered maybe trying to buy like different made whole grain bread or whole grain pasta\nC:\tyeah I mean we don't usually do it\nT:\tokay okay so you know that you need to not control your blood glucose levels right to maintain the healthy lifestyle so what are your goal is to try and do that or why why would you want to do that\nC:\twell I don't really do much exercising my husband you know sometimes their dog so\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso and then the exercise that's going to help by reducing the adipose tissue around your cells which will make it easier for the insulin to pick up the glucose and bring it into your cells so losing weight is always a key part in maintaining diet or helping to control diabetes and even if you're not necessarily using weight doing the exercise one really help you gain more muscle mass which what is the bad news and both is just another word for fat is it late with that around yourselves adipose tissue is that too soon yeah so okay so we've gone over some brainstorming ideas so let's pick some two or three things that we can really focus on so for next time maybe we can hopefully see a little luck because um before I said the doctor happened to give you a glucose meter do you know what that is or\nC:\tknow that when you pick your finger\nT:\tthat is what are you prick you maker yes and that will tell you what your blood glucose is so remind me at the end of thing and we can give you one of those if that sounds like a good option and then we can start having blood glucose readings and that will also manage your blood sugar that's a way to\nC:\thow about help\nT:\twell that will let you know where your blood glucose is so say in the mornings generally your blood who was this putting much lower because you've gone all night not having anything to eat you're gonna start the day fresh but at night it's kind of obvious that you've got all day you're eating you're tired your body's gone through a rough day your blood Sugar's public we're generally much more higher so if we have glucose readings say next time when you come in we can say see where you're at see if they're generally starting to decrease of what we're doing is helping or not and then you can go from there always and hopefully that will help so you won't have to run the medicine\nC:\tokay what would be a good range question\nT:\tusually we want to try and keep your blood Sugar's under 100 and especially in the morning waking up not having anything in your system I know 100 be a good number at night of course it's going to be a little bit higher so 120 80 would say we're trying to keep anything under there and you know what if you mess up and they're higher that's okay because things happen you may have wanted to go to a party that day eat a cake you know anything so things are going to fluctuate but if we come back and you generally have lower glucose that's as much that's very good sign much better for your body so so okay so I'll call these pretty serving things what do you think we can what are like two or three main things that you choose that you will focus on\nC:\tokay well I think testing is pretty important then I could definitely try to exercise more because I haven't really been doing much of that\nT:\tright right\nC:\tand then I maybe the whole grains too\nT:\tyeah and you always don't have to switch by it over either we can say go to the grocery store this time by white bread the next time I buy whole wheat bread or make your pasta half white half wheat things like that under sandwiches maybe one slice of white bread once it's we brighten everything up whatever work for you and also does your husband eat well or\nC:\tI mean we pretty much the same nothing right cooking\nT:\tokay so that's perfect do you think it's a good support\nC:\tI can try to get\nT:\tyeah exactly and you know what maintaining your health and maintaining his health is just going to better the both of you anyway so it's always nice to have someone to help support you and what you're doing and going on the walks\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand if instead of staying or going on a walk everyday maybe you can go every other day with him but it's a learning process so you don't have to jump into everything right away as long as you're taking the initiative now and trying that's always what's gonna help so if it goes wrong it is okay so let's go back and summarize what we've decided you know some be the three goals that\nC:\twe've shared more pool greens more exercise\nT:\tokay perfect and do you what times do you think will work good for testing for you or do you have an idea of how you'll like keep a journal maybe or\nC:\tso I can keep the journal I'm more of a morning person\nT:\tokay\nC:\tChuck Tesla\nT:\tin the morning and then you'll know what you are for the day you go from there they said that sounds good to me so you seem very motivated and excited like you want to get better and that's always a good sign\nC:\tI definitely want to stick around a long time for\nT:\tI agree that's yeah it's a mingle a lot of people healthy lifestyle so okay do you plan on coming back and see an appointment for next time or\nC:\tyeah that's a really good checkup\nT:\tokay does three months okay and that way we can give you a long time because well look at your anyone see again your anyone see is a measure of how sticky your blood is basically and so it's a three month measure so you would take it two or three months it'll tell you how much sugar and stuff on to the red blood cells of your body basically so we can see if it's higher or lower it'll tell how you're doing and so\nC:\tokay\nT:\tthat would be a good indicator where you're at next time I see you\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso thank you for coming in today Jamie\n",
  "T:\tyou in summary the minnesota state mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday cited for driving under the influence and then you are transported to detox plus you're only 21 years old is the report accurate\nC:\tI guess so I don't really remember much like those a week ago so I was kind of drawn to\nT:\tok behavior like this could get you suspended doesn't that concern you\nC:\tmm-hmm I mean not really I'm gonna be 21 in a couple months I'm potentially alone the cops came to me a minor I mean I'm not a heavy drinker like like my friends or anything I don't get wasted at all and I just hey be careful I just won't get caught I'm just trying to find like a normal college student\nT:\twhat were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers you could have caused an accident and killed somebody\nC:\twhatever I didn't know I called my roommates for a ride you sleepy so idea home somehow and this is name of my fault I can ride all the time but I didn't do anything\nT:\tyou need to take responsibility for your actions do you keep partying like this your problems will only get worse you're likely to face costly legal citations for grades health problems getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents you don't want that to happen do you\nC:\tno no like I said this is my fault like are we done here have class in 15 minutes\nT:\tyour behavior is now a Minnesota State University expects of its students if you want to be a student here you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules do you think you can do that otherwise you'll be suspended\nC:\tlook I really like corn I miss you and I gilja sand you you're making some really good points and i'll think about them okay\nT:\tokay well your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that will cost you one hundred and fifty dollars also disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer\nC:\t$150 are you serious I can't pay that all right I'm done with those I'm good\nT:\tin summary the minnesota state mankato security report states that you are stopped on Stadium Road last Friday excited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox plus the report lists your ages twenty Dillon what is the accuracy of the report and can you share with me some details leading up to the incident\nC:\tI guess that sounds that sounds right I mean I was kind of drunk and it happened like a week ago I just I drove over to my friends house just to go watch the game and you know we're having a couple beers and X and O the Vikings accountabilities in pretty big so we drank a little bit more than usual and I mean at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride so I just rolled\nT:\tyou decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home you decided to drive yourself home did I get that right\nC:\tyeah that's exactly how it happened I mean I'm a normal college kid I had to drink in a house and buddies I mean it wasn't a big house party or anything that got busted\nT:\tyeah I understand that your intention would have a good time while watching the game with your friends you didn't think about what could go wrong when you drink alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home\nC:\tand I tried to be safe I mean I tried to call her roommate but I am getting in trouble anyways\nT:\tdawn you told me what brought you here today what do you think the problem really is\nC:\tum let's say I have a drinking problem I think I probably have more of a like getting caught problem I mean my friends they drink like fishes and I they don't ever get cotton and you got me over here and I get caught and left\nT:\tsounds like you attribute your current situation a bad luck if that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior what consequences might result\nC:\tI guess I got some more problems with police in school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that\nT:\thow important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school villain\nC:\tit's just super important because just just going to detox alone was was awful the experience I don't want to do that again and my dad said if I get suspended from school I'll have to have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social I don't see any of my friends and I mean it's already bad enough like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI\nT:\tyeah what would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended\nC:\twell yes I I guess the easy one is I want to drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more likely to get in trouble so probably I don't want to drink so much\nT:\ton a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with ten being very confident\nC:\tI guess I would say like I don't like over halfway is so maybe like a sex\nT:\twhat steps could you take to move that six or seven or eight\nC:\tI could probably I guess well it's the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so then I'm not risking myself to drive very like if I go out to a party waiting to like I'm 21 to drink maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking like I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do the just drink\nT:\tin what ways might your life be better if you succeed in making the changes you mentioned\nC:\tum I mean I guess the big one would be like I went I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8 a.m. then well even even when I make it to my ATM's now like I just I sleep like I wake up I'm like oh my god what's going on and then I get to my 8 a.m. and I'll just sleep through and then I'm this just about everything that's on the test so I think if I if I reprioritize what is important to me it probably helped me succeed I mean in high school I had a 3.5 GPA is I know I could do it here\nT:\tCollege is all about making choices can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking\nC:\tum I mean education is really important to me and and also my family talking about it and I really I really want to be an international journalist to be on the news like I mean I have the face for it so I guess if I reprioritize mind if I read prioritize what I need to do like and I won't drink so much I probably want to be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education\nT:\tthanks for coming in for participating today your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150 RS\nC:\tOh what is the seminar\n",
  "T:\tgreat session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you've met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged great so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule\nC:\tokay\nT:\tthis will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording there's a back pain do not return okay so before we do this I'd like to read explore why you sought out physical therapy in the first place okay does it sound okay to you\nC:\tyeah it does you know the you know ever since the new year I've been trying to get back into you know being more active and playing basketball and all that stuff but I've been seems like I'm hitting a wall quite a bit\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI have a lot of obstacles and having trouble getting through it\nT:\tokay well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way\nC:\tso as you as you know my buddy's been playing you know basketball pickup and I've been trying to do trying to do that and that caused me some back pain in the past and it's been a struggle for me to do that so I went to doctor and the doctor gave me some some pain medication and the pain medication worked for for a while but it seemed like it didn't really take care of it so then I started I try I try to try to do basketball again but then I had more pain from that so I'm really stuck with it with going back to basketball because it's a pain\nT:\twell it sounds like you you've really struggled that back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and INSAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life\nC:\twell I have been trying to eat better but it's been quite difficult to maintain for a pro for a long period of time work is getting busier and I'm getting closer to about six hours a night but three things definitely isn't the best for me you know I feel much better when I'm exercising but when this back pain calmed on everything just seems to fall apart and definitely makes me less active\nT:\twell you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active\nC:\tyeah I did I definitely felt a lot better felt like I was like turning a new chapter in my life and I'd like to think that I would being more proactive about my health\nT:\tokay well it sounds like you realized that when you started to change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring bouts of back pain in the first place\nC:\tI don't think I was in the proper physical shape to be playing basketball you know with my friends you know I said that at a desk for about eight hours a day and I go from there to play in basketball the rest and the medications didn't have some positive effects initially but it seemed like they were not helping overall yes a pain came right back\nT:\tI think I think you're right you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a stress and that something needs to change there are many other things that play into why pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pick-up basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you\nC:\tyes I definitely think so I mean working eight hours a day and going to play basketball my body was\nT:\tdefinitely not ready for that definitely you know because many factors influence we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but I think that the physical capability good body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and I think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that\nC:\twell I definitely understand that you know I really haven't exercised in a couple years and because everything's been pretty crazy at home very hectic lots of hours at home or kids have been busy things that in the job is very busy just hectic I thought playing basketball be great for me I think it is but I definitely wasn't ready to step right back in and I didn't realize my body needed more more preparedness to give into that\nT:\tyou have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on and so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects that accompany that\nC:\twell I guess I could go for short walks with my wife after work definitely be less stress on my body and be some type of exercise for me in terms of work it would make sense if I got up once in a while from my chair and just walk around that would make sense and it'd be good for me\nT:\tgreat it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know we start with walking let your body adapt as you have been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health\nC:\tyeah certainly I definitely feel that consistency is important untie I'm tired of starting and stopping starting and stopping I definitely want to be more consistent\nT:\tbrilliant you've got it consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise\nC:\twell my wife walks four or five times a week and each time she walks is about thirty minutes I could probably do that also at work I think I could get up and walk around every up you know these once every hour\nT:\tsounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero being not confident at all and ten being 100% confident how confident are you that you will be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime\nC:\tI would probably say about a six or seven\nT:\tbut you're not a zero that tells me you've got some confidence in making a change so let me ask you why are you confident you know\nC:\tas I said before I'm tired of starting stopping and I'm just tired that and I also I think I could lose I could use to lose a few pounds\nT:\tokay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving Moore's work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively\nC:\tyes I definitely think so\nT:\tbut you're not a 10 that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a 10 or even an eight or a nine\nC:\tI think if I give my my whole family involved that will certainly help also if I can set you know small realistic goals for myself I think that will keep keep me motivated you know in the past you know like we talked about a few times already that you know I'm always stopping and starting I think if I if I do those things I won't I won't do that and also I think that I'll stay more motivated and there to help you probably lead myself to better healthier lifestyle\nT:\tbrilliant I get the impression that you want to stay on course with starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain the best way to do this is as we said staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated you know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside during this progression it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road as I sort of build confidence and increase the strength and resiliency of your body so if I saw you in two weeks what would you tell me with regards to hell your new exercise regime is going\nC:\tI will tell you that I'm consistent I will tell you I'm feeling much better I'll tell you I would probably have little pain if any and I'll tell you I'm more active in an overall I just tell you I'm very healthy\nT:\tgood good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from zero to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime\nC:\tdefinitely attend definitely\nT:\tI agree you know overall most comments in your brain let's see you in two weeks crazy idea\nC:\tokay perfect thank you\n",
  "T:\tI was Jones nice to see you again\nC:\tdoctor how are you today\nT:\tI'm doing great things now we have about 15 minutes today and I want to make sure that we talk about what's important to you however I do want to take some time at the beginning to talk about your recent lab work would that be okay\nC:\toh definitely I mean I guess that's something I should be concerned about with you bringing it up I knew my blood pressure so going up a little bit but I didn't know anything else was a concern\nT:\tthe blood sugars have increased some so you're concerned that things are not as good as they were last time that we talked\nC:\tyeah that's right I did notice that my morning blood sugars were coming up a little bit I just didn't realize how serious it was\nT:\tright why I'd certainly didn't mean to startle you but there has been a significant increase in your that a1c that three-month average on your blood sugar yeah so that's gone from you've been doing so great we'd brought it down from over 9 to about 7.5 and now it's kind of bounced back up to 8.4 and I'm wondering if you had any ideas as to why that might have happened\nC:\twell you know I was reading about the januvia that we added and read some concerning things on the internet it might cause pancreatitis and cancer and I just was scared to death of that so I stopped taking my medication I guess I should have told you about that\nT:\tum telling me would have been great but that's okay I mean you had a concern about a medication that you dread some things about and you stopped the medication I think that's a good thing that's a good decision\nC:\twow I'm glad to know you're not too angry with me you know we're not I've read that cancer was a possibility it just terrified me because my mother had died of breast cancer and I just didn't want any of that\nT:\thow long ago was that\nC:\toh it's it's been a little while but it was the tough process and I certainly don't want to see myself there\nT:\tso the concern of cancer was probably the main thing that me\nC:\tyes\nT:\tbut stop the medication\nC:\twell and you know - sometimes I didn't feel so good when you know the new medication combines with the metformin that I was on sometimes I would be nauseous and just uncomfortable\nT:\tso you were nauseated anything else\nC:\tOh sometimes diarrhea and sometimes the nausea was so bad even one day I didn't go to work\nT:\tso quite a bit of nausea the diarrhea and then you also have that fear of cancer\nC:\tyes\nT:\tum how are you feeling now\nC:\twell you know I guess my thoughts are that if I don't have to take so much medication you know that would make me feel better too many pills you know I just feel like I shouldn't be taking so much medication but obviously we do have to do something about the blood sugar\nT:\ttell me what you know about the consequences of having high blood sugars that are untreated\nC:\twell I know you know in reading on the internet and doing my research certainly could end up blind or on dialysis and I know some people have even lost limbs that's really scary to me I don't want that either\nT:\tso on the one hand there are some things that really scare you about having diabetes that's uncontrolled and on the other hand it's been difficult for you I know we've talked in the past about working on controlling your your diet and looking at your way so where does that leave you at this point\nC:\twell I guess if I don't want to take more pills I have to give up some of my sweets my cookies and my potato chips\nT:\tso those types of sweets and crunchy stuff and salty stuff is is pretty important to you\nC:\tyeah I'm a snacker unfortunately and it's always been hard that was my downfall every time I've tried to dye it before giving up the carbs was just so hard for me\nT:\tso some of the problems you've had in the past you've had some failures you you've tried something tummy tell me a little bit more about some of the things that you've tried already\nC:\twell you know I've tried to Adkins in the past and it actually worked for me for a little while once I got used to it but then I just felt sluggish like I had no energy and and even kind of felt depressed\nT:\tso you felt fatigued and somewhat depressed while you were on the Atkins diet that's something I hear not yeah pretty it's pretty often I think that if it's okay we could talk about that for a minute if that's something\nC:\tsure I'd like that\nT:\tso carbohydrates actually do make us feel better they actually raise something called serotonin\nC:\tno wonder I like them so much\nT:\tall right have you heard of serotonin\nC:\tyes I had\nT:\tasked kind of a happy horn but yeah so as we do eat simple carbohydrates in particular those rays are our serotonin levels so that we actually do feel better and so some people on the Atkins diet actually do feel depressed and fatigued because their your serotonin levels aren't as high but that can be a dangerous cycle because as we raise our blood sugar you know we feel good if it's as if it's a simple sugar though blood sugar goes up insulin goes up we tend to crash we tend to eat more which tends to do the cycle of carbohydrate cravings\nC:\tso that's why I crave that bag of potato chips\nT:\tI think I\nC:\tdon't make sense\nT:\tyeah so um what sort of things can you think about that could maybe calm those blood sugar swings down\nC:\tWow I guess that I don't know enough about nutrition and diet I guess I need more information you know food has always been a Comfort thing for me my family gets together we have big meals need around the holidays so you know it's hard when you give up those things that you really love to stay focused so I guess that need more information\nT:\tsounds like there's a lot of emotional investment for you and your family around food that can make things more difficult and that those may be some barriers that we need to talk about if it's okay would it be alright if we talked a little bit more about some of the other low carb diets that are out there\nC:\tsure\nT:\tand what do you know about low carb diets can you you know if any that come to mind\nC:\twell I think I've heard about South Beach and of course Adkins that we mentioned um are there others\nT:\tthere are there's a couple out there one called protein power and but a lot of my patients have had a lot of luck with South Beach diet wouldn't be already I'm\nC:\tsure I'd like that\nT:\twell early on in the South Beach the first two weeks is called phase one and that's a very low carb time but during that time carbohydrate cravings people tell me typically really really calm down but even in that first phase in South Beach you can have again healthy salads and healthy carbohydrates then you kind of build on up and even in level two there are some actually healthy cookie recipes\nC:\toh wow that's exciting\nT:\tso in a limited state we may be able to give you some of your cookies back mmm so shown\nC:\tum I just might can try this\nT:\tso on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready to make a change zero being really not ready at all where do you think you are at this point\nC:\twell you know I I think I'm a nine I think you know I really don't want to take the medication I'm afraid of cancer and other side effects from too many meds I've got to do something about the blood sugar spikes and what you're telling me I'm outside South Beach sounds like maybe I can do that\nT:\tthat sounds like you're fairly ready to do something that's good and how do you think will deal with some of these carbohydrate cravings\nC:\tWow well I guess I need a support group I need you know somebody I can turn to when I'm having a tough day and also more information about the snacks I can't have that will make me healthier\nT:\tright okay so one of the great things about South Beach is I think it's for $7.99 a month or something like that you can get tied in and have your own registered dietician did you have regular appointments with\nC:\tthat would be awesome\nT:\tyeah and they can help you through recipes and and also give you some strategies on the carbohydrate cravings so does that make sense\nC:\tsounds like a plan I really am excited about this as a possibility\nT:\tokay well you're you're obviously a very inquisitive and intelligent lady and I think you'll have good success with this the other thing that we can offer is we do have a weight management support group here at the practice that meets on a weekly basis and I think quite a few of those folks are also doing the the South Beach so having some of that social facilitation may help as well is that something you think we might be interested in\nC:\tyes I think that would be great\nT:\tMiss Jones you had said that uh maybe your confidence level wasn't too great because of some of the failures and kind of stop starts that you'd had in the past so if I can use another one of those scales on a confidence 0 being no confidence at all that you can do this or 10 being very confidence you can do this where do you think you are in terms of\nC:\tStefan maybe even an eighth that this will work for me this time I'm feeling better\nT:\ttell me more about why a 7 or an 8 and not 4 or 5\nC:\tthe support-group sound great the the website with the diet and the recipes and all of the things to support me in doing this and if the South Beach diet is going to help me with my carb cravings this might work\nT:\tgood so it sounds like we have a plan if it's ok I'll again give you this information sheet that has the website information and costs and that sort of thing we'll give you the information on the weight management support group and there's even some information on exercise there if that's something that you're interested in at some point and and if it's ok we'll see you back in 2 or 3 weeks is there a day miss change that would be best for you to start this diet\nC:\twell I need a little time to buy the right foods and read up on the the diet and information and the recipes maybe Monday would be good\nT:\tso Monday very good it sounds like we have a plan\nC:\tright thank you doctor\nT:\tthank you for your time and we'll see you in several weeks\nC:\tok\nT:\tbye\n",
  "T:\thi-oh Vina how are you doing today it's good to see you\nC:\tI'm just tired\nT:\tjust tired\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq-2 which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq-9 and that actually did come up with a score of 8 which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel\nC:\twell I knew I felt different I didn't know I was depressed\nT:\tbut you knew something was something was wrong\nC:\tI didn't feel like myself or have it and feeling like myself no\nT:\ttell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself\nC:\twhen I just go to work and I come home and I sleep I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired I just have no energy\nT:\tso you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested\nC:\tno not at all\nT:\tdoesn't sound like good quality sleep\nC:\tno I just have no energy I don't want to do anything but just sleep\nT:\thow long has that been going on\nC:\thmm I guess a couple months\nT:\t2 or 3 months\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhat else is going on w-\nC:\twell you know I been drinking more I drink socially but I find myself that when I come home you know I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep\nT:\tand that's worrisome to you\nC:\tit is cuz I don't usually drink that often during the week so it's increased yeah\nT:\tyeah I can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with you\nC:\twell you know my mom died a year ago so Mother's Day is coming up so you never think about mom a lot I miss her a lot\nT:\tthat anniversary is is close\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthat's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time I\nC:\tyeah and I took care of mom so that's hard because for a long time well she was sick and she died from cancer so I took care of her so for a long time that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was so now that she's gone it just kind of brings up everything all over again\nT:\tit's kind of a hole in your life\nC:\tyeah we were really close\nT:\tI'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me I know that's I know that's very difficult so it sounds like your sleep has really been affected you're not getting good quality sleep you're really fatigued\nC:\tyeah I'm\nT:\tjust kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day and then how's your appetite been\nC:\tI'm not really eating that much you know so I have energy you know before I would come home cook dinner or you know meet some friends after work but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine just go to bed\nT:\tso you used to be more socially involved than you are now\nC:\tyeah don't do anything now\nT:\ta little more isolated\nC:\tyeah just working come home and sleep\nT:\tso if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do\nC:\twell I don't want to stay like this this isn't Who I am you know just sleeping all the time this is I don't want to stay this way\nT:\tkind of feels like you're stuck\nC:\tyes\nT:\tat this point\nC:\tyeah I just don't want to do anything or go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep I don't want to do that\nT:\tit's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression\nC:\tokay\nT:\tlike you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point\nC:\tno\nT:\tall right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that\nC:\tI'm okay with that you know when Mom was sick you know she was in hospice care so she had cancer and the nurses and the doctors you know had our family talked to someone you know about what we were feeling you know\nT:\tso that was the face pretty good experience\nC:\tyeah yeah to talk to someone that understood what we were going through\nT:\tsure something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those\nC:\tmaybe something natural exercise I don't have energy I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything so I know I'm not going to exercise right now but if it's something that's natural you know I can maybe try that\nT:\tokay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she someone who's out in the community\nC:\tshe was really nice for me yeah I liked her so\nT:\tit sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready zero being not ready at all how ready would you be to do some counselling\nC:\tmaybe like a six or seven so a six or seven\nT:\tY a six or seven and not a four or a five well\nC:\tbecause I don't want to stay like this and you know I've already talked to her before she was really nice so I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know when I saw her last time if ever needed I could come back\nT:\tso it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tum does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that\nC:\tyeah I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twell that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain\nC:\tokay\nT:\texercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants\nC:\tokay I didn't know that\nT:\tyeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tIt's kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point\nC:\twell if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again does that mean I have to run the medication right now we can try that\nT:\tabsolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it\nC:\twell I'll try then let's go on the medication\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI have some friends they exercise and workout that I could probably call and exercise with them\nT:\tso you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tis that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group\nC:\tyeah I have friends that run and friends that go to gym I have some friends that walk after work\nT:\tso it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhich of those tend to interest you most\nC:\twell then also you know my church on the weekends they have exercise classes too so yeah but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away\nT:\tvery good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise\nC:\twell when I saw her I could see her after work so I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy and exercise I mean I can do that you know after work or on the weekends my friends they exercise various time so yeah\nT:\tlet's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all in 10 being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing\nC:\thonestly maybe a five\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI'll try it anything I have to do that so I don't have to go on medication then I'll try it\nT:\tokay that sounds like a pretty strong commitment\nC:\tyes I'll try it\nT:\tokay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point then\nC:\twell you know my friends have been calling but you know I'm just sleeping all the time so when they call them sleep so I haven't really called them back but I know I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and you know at least maybe just start walking\nT:\tI think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call\nC:\tyeah real close close friends that live not too far from me yeah\nT:\tso tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise\nC:\twell I probably shouldn't come home I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friends house after work and change with her\nT:\tso it would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening\nC:\tno because it's so hard when I get up in the room so tired that I can't I can't say doing in the morning\nT:\tyou think it would be easier to do it after work\nC:\tcuz I'm already out yeah as long as I don't come home so I come on Monica's sleep\nT:\tcome home it's over\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tall right well good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through\nC:\tokay\nT:\ther passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program\nC:\tokay I'll try that\nT:\tall right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working\nC:\tokay\n",
  "T:\tOh so how are you today\nC:\tnot bad I guess Thanks pretty good actually yeah\nT:\twell let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones\nC:\tno no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so so\nT:\twell you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso I wondered it to get started if as a few things that we just lay out before we get going\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and I do want to point out that anything that you say to us will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly I do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that that it sounds as though you rather put yourself at risk imminent risk or putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that\nC:\tokay\nT:\tis there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about\nC:\tno I I understand it sounds good I mean I understand so yeah yeah\nT:\twell there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here\nC:\twell I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of gotten myself into some trouble because because of that\nT:\ttell me more about that\nC:\twell I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous sir\nT:\tsure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this\nC:\tyeah okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome\nT:\tso quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities\nC:\twell yeah yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well I mean my wife gets upset about that and dicky so\nT:\tcould you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you\nC:\twell the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of little bit down because of that and I thought you know my friend's been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much\nT:\tso you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much\nC:\tyeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you I've been I've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and\nT:\ttime back on the cold\nC:\twell\nT:\tyou've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now\nC:\twell I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control\nT:\tout of control\nC:\tyeah I know some people that are are worse than me\nT:\tbut thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things\nC:\tI guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke and and well okay I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the backseat and and the driver had done kind of the same thing you know he'd done some coke and some booze and and it was is it was pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so\nT:\tso the sliding it's very scary\nC:\tyeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day I mean and I don't even remember\nT:\tso it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things\nC:\tyeah I guess not remembering this has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and and and you know this is gonna sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my Facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them so\nT:\tso quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you\nC:\tyeah yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really gonna regret\nT:\tyour family your wife your friends are all really important to you\nC:\tvery very important\nT:\tthinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious\nC:\twell I mean eight I don't know a you know eight out of ten if that's you know\nT:\tthat makes a lot sense\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay now so you're roughly eight\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four\nC:\twell I guess because it's been been causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and and\nT:\tit's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing\nC:\tyeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand I'm because it's it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine\nT:\tso and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work\nC:\tI be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that and\nT:\tI guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it\nC:\tWow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that\nT:\tit's it's surprising\nC:\twell you know see the thing is is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and\nT:\twhat else do you make of it\nC:\twell I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and he ain't gonna be the beer I guess\nT:\tso for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine\nC:\tit's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine mix like you say they do it and all that\nT:\tso thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I won't know confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident\nC:\twell I mean I'm be honest is yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe four\nT:\tfour\nC:\tmaybe maybe five four I don't know like yeah\nT:\tfour so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one\nC:\tI sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess\nT:\tso a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop\nC:\twell yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them I suppose\nT:\tso there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them\nC:\tyeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available\nT:\tand these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work\nC:\tokay yeah that's okay\nT:\tyeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent users you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you you\n",
  "T:\thi Hannah nice to meet you hi so I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties\nC:\thmm yeah um yeah I guess it kind of started like five six years ago\nT:\tokay\nC:\tum it kind of escalated a bit and I've just recently moved out um from living with my parents so it made it a bit worse I think\nT:\tokay is this the first time that you've left home\nC:\tyeah I am yes first time much the yeah um I was going to a few years ago just thought it would be easier to stay home\nT:\tokay so it's been quite a big step in a big change and and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso how has that change things for you\nC:\tum Gennaro its kind of I haven't really told anyone so I mean it's made up like better and since I feel hopefully this is this is it like oh cool it'll help but I don't know I don't like thinking that I've like had to do this I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help that makes sense\nT:\tokay so how do you feel about being here today\nC:\tfits like scared I don't know hopefully it will help\nT:\tokay so we'd be a little bit anxious about today\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so I guess just going back to and why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today so it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years but just recently moved out of home for the first time\nC:\tannum\nT:\tand that was what kind of led you to go to the GP so how did that change things how were things after you moved out and\nC:\tI thought that they'd be better but because I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and space actually a lot were so I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot I don't really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit but it's not I don't know it's kind of scary because I've just been kind of let you just in the flat by myself which I always thought I'd like but I don't actually like it\nT:\tokay so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing\nC:\tI mean I'm I'm a photographer and so I kind of it's been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and because every time you know there's an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it on so I was kind of making things hard in that respect and just kind of friends wise and everything I'd feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone so it's kind of stopping me from making friends and you know like relationships and stuff\nT:\tO'Casey said that your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things so they're they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they're also stopping you or you feel like it is stunting you socially you're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people\nC:\tyeah yeah and it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents as have lost fine but you know they would I'd go to places with them or I'd kind of have people there but more and more I'm just finding myself just staying again a lot I mean I went like two weeks give coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again so I don't I just don't want to I don't want that to happen I don't want to lose everyone so huh\nT:\tsee kind of worried about how where this is going to lead to\nC:\tyeah um yeah\nT:\tso you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago so you would have been about 19 yeah and what was happening around that time\nC:\tI guess I'd finished school about a year before that and I mean I've always been a bit shy at school but it was never ever like it didn't really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don't know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there I just stopped going to parties all right say no two invitations or and I thought my job would help because I mean I love it I really like doing photography but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on so which is my fire keep saying no but\nT:\twhat kind of work is the most difficult for you am your job\nC:\tI guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don't like that it's like when I'm trying to kind of would do an event or something where there's a lot of people they're not just photographers but actual you know if I like taking phrases of people that I don't know I just kind of find myself saying now I mean I want to do them but just scary so I just don't do it\nT:\tso I has tell me a bit more about what happens then so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with you know it's going to involve photography with with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction what kind of thoughts go through your head\nC:\tjust I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don't I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid and feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking I just can't do my job and I'm just an idiot and I mean they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else so that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera because then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to you know be with other people\nT:\tokay so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at another point where you get that invitation you think people look people stare people will think I'm a weirdo there's quite a lot about what what you think other people will think\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand how does that make you feel and\nC:\tjust makes me feel like an idiot makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anyway I should just go home and I just I think I just don't want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak you can't like do normal things and\nT:\tokay can you give me an example of a recent situation maybe we can focus on that\nC:\tlike a work situation\nT:\tyeah time when you may be doing a job with some people and you've got the social anxiety you know that you're describing about that kick in\nC:\tyeah and I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoe and I was having to work with a lot of different people and and and when they told me about the job I thought it would be fine I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers but there are actually people and you know I've taken photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that and I get they asked me to him\nT:\tthat sounds quite interesting was that a fashion shoot\nC:\tyeah yeah it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something but yeah it was really cool both find it found it really hard to try and focus on max I was so I was kind of feeling really anxious and\nT:\tso it wasn't what you expected\nC:\tno no\nT:\tso how long ago was that that was two weeks ago\nC:\tokay so it's quite recent yeah so on that particular day what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation\nT:\tjust felt really just really kind of heart I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just focus and just you know like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they'd say action and they'd try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and\nC:\tI can tell you getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tokay so you describe him quite a lot there to me so you're saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty he said that you held the camera yeah what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or I was just like I focused on it I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly it would just I don't know I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just further\nT:\tyou're holding the camera very tight\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand why was that why was that helpful because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just though at least if I can just I don't know it sounds weird but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands are kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads like and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it it wouldn't be as noticeable but\nC:\tokay so okay so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head and he said that you worried that everyone's looking at you what other thoughts were there that were in your mind\nT:\tjust I was just just stupid and was just really just felt really like a kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just they could tell and just thinking or what what's she doing and\nC:\tthey could tell what\nT:\tthat I was just really like sweaty and just so fat\nC:\tso oh like that they could see that\nT:\tyeah yeah and I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers so they can't tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just was just wishing that I just wasn't there\nC:\tso I mean you've already described it to me a little bit but if you think about how you look that day how do you say how do you think he looked\nT:\tI think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew vow'd was probably sweating and shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and and ever it was like definitely really noticeable everyone could definitely stay\nC:\tok and what did you do about how did you try and conceal that or hide that and\nT:\twell again I was trying to grip the camera just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean that they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and look down not try it like not look at anyone else and just yeah just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but\nC:\tso you avoid looking at people and sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tno I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because was I'll just be really sweaty and like people would definitely be able to see so\nT:\tokay and how did it end\nC:\twell it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it I just I went home straight away just got in my car and went home I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to go get home straight away\nT:\tokay\n",
  "T:\tgood morning Tony\nC:\they\nT:\tmy name is Alex and I'm going to be the nurse taking care of you today so could you please tell me a little bit of about why you're here\nC:\tI don't even know why I'm here I don't know my mom says I'm obese\nT:\tso you were your mom suggested to come here because you were obese\nC:\tyeah I mean I guess so that's why she sent me here yeah honestly she's so mad how they're gonna why everything I don't think I am\nT:\tokay can I ask you do you see yourself as overweight\nC:\tNo I don't I don't I don't think I'm overweight or obese or whatever she thinks so so that's why I figure\nT:\tokay well can I tell you a little bit about what being overweight means\nC:\tyes sure\nT:\tokay so what it is is basically how we determine that is we're using the BMI so body mass index scale and at the end of it it gives us a number and a number of 25 and higher is associated with being overweight so based on your physical exam results earlier on you're at the 95th percentile\nC:\t95th\nT:\tvery top of the scale which for lack of a better word but she was overweight\nC:\tokay well you sure you're right I mean I thought maybe like 27 or something else but\nT:\tNo thats what I have here\nC:\t95th wow geez I didn't even know what I like okay like what's gonna happen to me now like should I be concern is something gonna happen\nT:\tthere are health risks associated with it but I don't want to scare you I'm going to inform you but before we get there do you mind if I get to know you in your situation a little bit better\nC:\tyeah sure what do you want to know\nT:\tso what I like to do is get a little bit of history so throughout this do you mind if I ask you a questions regarding your diet and exercise habits\nC:\tYeah sure\nT:\tokay so so to start us off could you tell me a little bit about what you eat throughout the day so how's your habit like\nC:\twell I guess like in the morning I'd never eat breakfast it's just like I'm always late you're in a rush and my mom doesn't make breakfast so I don't so when I get to school I tend to be hungry so I go for like the first a large cookie usually and make a large chocolate milk and that usually lasts until lunchtime\nT:\tokay\nC:\tand then I have lunch with my buddies we go to the CAF and the regional get french fries and pizza and then after I eat my lunch I usually have like a bag of chips and like two or three pops with my lunch\nT:\tokay all right so can you tell me a little bit more about what you like about that kind of food\nC:\tit's comforting okay it's fast it's easy to grab easy to get it tends to be cheap and I get it's like surrounded her it's always it's all around me all the time you know my friends do it like my friends did I eat it with them and I guess it's kind of like a social thing for me my mom isn't cooked so I used to eat it when I get home\nT:\toh ok\nC:\tso it's it's literally everywhere\nT:\tso let me try to understand so you enjoy it because it's convenient it's on the go and it's always readily available when you need it your friends engage in it and your mom doesn't think it's not exactly of a cookers as much as I understand\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so could you tell me a little bit about what are some things that you don't really like about it\nC:\twell I mean sometimes they make it and there's just so much grease on it that I have the dab it with a napkin to get rid of the greese\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tsometimes the line of the calf like it's so long and like my knees were at my back hurts just stand there waiting for it\nT:\tokay\nC:\tand to think about it like it's just I guess something to do with my body like that's why I'm yeah right I don't have a I don't have a girlfriend so maybe it's to do something the way I look I'm sure\nT:\tso let me try to further understand so given the positives you just told me but you also feel like you're in pain for what I'm understanding your back on your knees and it's greasy and maybe you think that it's contributing to your body image and potentially affecting your relationships\nC:\tthat about the summarizes it yeah okay\nT:\tso given that what you just told me do you think that the food is contributing to your weight gain\nC:\tyeah like if you put it that way I do think it does contribute when we gain plus like I hate to say it but like mom I think my mom is right like she her nagging is annoying but I think she just means well and once you know for my health it's just for my health\nT:\tok so not that I think we covered food and I understand a little bit better can I ask you about your exercise habits some things like any physical activity you engage in or anything like that\nC:\tI mean exercises mean exercise don't cold water they're like that's just not my thing okay like I don't plan on going to a gym I don't plan on getting into membership like just I mean exercise don't work\nT:\tokay so if I understand you correctly it is about your priority right now\nC:\tdefinitely not my bird oh I think that's like maybe I can focus on something more like eating habits maybe but definitely not exercise\nT:\tokay so I'm glad to hear that so can I ask you are you considering about making any changes to what you died at this point\nC:\tyeah like I mean like when I think about it now I don't want to develop some sort of illness in the future and like I definitely don't want to hear from my mom like a colony over way of nagging I mean like so this is definitely something that I'm considered\nT:\tok\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso I five believes so if I understand it correctly you're considering to make that change because you don't want to develop a chronic illness later on the life in essentially avoiding conflict with your mother is that correct\nC:\tyes that's correct\nT:\tokay so can I ask you on a scale of zero to ten now that you're considering about making a change zero being not important whatsoever and ten being super uber important how important is it for you to make this change\nC:\twhat's it's about like a six well\nT:\tokay all right and let me ask you another question using a scale again so from scale of zero to ten zero being I'm not confident whatsoever and 10 being I'm super confident how confident are you that you will be able to make this change\nC:\tlet's be honest I would say about like a 4 okay yeah I'm not really that confident\nT:\tokay so you are on the higher end of the scale in terms of how important it is to you to make that change however you are in the lower end of the scale in terms of your confidence what choose 4\nC:\twell like I said earlier like fast food is comforting to me and it's all around me and when I like my friends you did\nT:\tokay\nC:\tmy mom doesn't know the cooks like you don't I get home alright so I just feel that like it's a big part of my life and if I just take it away it's gonna be hard I personally don't feel like I have the will to just like control myself\nT:\tokay\nC:\tbecause like I just feel like I'm just gonna break and like maybe grab a few fries and my friends or something and I'm like I just feel like I mean oh I don't have the will to do thing but at the same time there's you've made me like realize the good of the bad\nT:\tokay yeah\nC:\tand I see that like I really do need to be this because it's gonna be the best very\nT:\twell I'm thank you for telling me that I'm glad to hear that I was able to provide you with some information so that you can take control of your situation so thank you so much but can I ask you something else in order to change or in this case increase that confidence from before to maybe something higher is there anything that can help you with that\nC:\twell to think about it my my friends were like if they were to eat healthy with me I think that it would help me like increase my confidence and you know accomplish just because like you know they peer pressure and like there would be five days to reach everyday at school right where the see eachother all the time\nT:\tright okay\nC:\tanother one with us I would say is like maybe my mom like learned to cook something yeah\nT:\tlike cooking class\nC:\tyeah I'm really good cooking class something cooking book or YouTube or something\nT:\tokay okay\nC:\tcook something so I want to take a seconds or a few minutes\nT:\tI want to say congratulations first of all for coming to see me I know with your mom nagging and that must it must be frustrating for you but it is you took that initiative you no matter through your mom's nagging you still came to see me so congratulations on that\nC:\tThank you\nT:\tand I really want to say also congratulations to taking this first step and seeing that this is something that could benefit you so that you don't want because from what I understand you don't want to develop any chronic illness or any sort of health risk\nC:\toh no no\nT:\tso thank you so thank you for being here and congratulations again for taking that first step so right now would you like to discuss the potential health risks associated with weight gain and overeating junk food\nC:\tto be honest like I mean we learn about it's in health class and like my mom has to given me these brochures so many times I've read them I kind of get the gist of it\nT:\toh I understand\nC:\tyeah no health teaching today yeah\nT:\tI'm tired of the nagging I got I know the time to be\nC:\tgot it all right so where would you like to go from here is there any idea that you have that we can start with and you think that you can do during the week\nT:\twe can do to help you with this change well like was thinking about it maybe like I don't want nothing to do with exercise\nC:\tgot it\nT:\tbut maybe you we can do some sort of like I don't know meal planner I don't know like something to do with like my diet maybe reduce what I'm eating\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou know modify some of the things I'm eating I guess like I know pop is bad for me and that those chips so maybe I couldn't like reduce some of that maybe and change it from three to three to one pop a day\nC:\tgot it\nT:\tthere's no more chips okay\nC:\tso it looks like you have an idea that could potentially do contribute to you to your decreasing what you eat or in this case substituting what you eat in my correct yes make suggestion\nT:\tyes\nC:\tmay I make a suggestion\nT:\tyeah sure\nC:\tsometimes what happens is in order for people to fully realize the behavior that they're engaging in sometimes what ends up in the notices with other clients writing down seems to help so I know what this might sound lame but are you open to the idea of keeping some kind of a log list journal or anything like that that indicates on it somewhere what you're eating and we're and also what you're substituting are you open to that idea\nT:\tI mean I guess it's like I can see where you're coming like where it could benefit\nC:\tokay\nT:\tum so yeah I mean it's worth a shot I mean how how bad can it be right I mean I have nothing to lose so\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyeah why not I'll try it so over the next couple of weeks so if we were to set up a follow-up appointment would you be comfortable of keeping that journal and then coming to me after so we can review it together\nC:\tyeah of course okay you're really good at this thing\nT:\tthank you so can we let's recap what we talked about today so you came here to see me despite your mom nagging and making you feel like you have to be here because she said so but you were able to see that you were able to identify that this is something this is your decision this is something that would benefit you instead of your mom so you given me the goods and the bads of your junk food and you were able to essentially come up with some kind of an action plan so where its building that awareness of junk food and by being open to the idea of keeping a log is there anything I missed\nC:\tno I think you got it you got most of it are all of it\nT:\tyeah so can we make a follow up appointment where we can review that journal after to see what's working for you what's not working for you yeah sure\nC:\tif something isn't working for you we can always go back to the drawing board\nT:\tokay\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso shall we set up set up that appointment\nT:\tyes please Nurse Alice\nC:\tokay thank you\nT:\tI'll see you a couple of weeks\nC:\tall right thanks meeting you Tony thank you\n",

stage okay so I mean you're clearly anxious now as you mentioned let's go to trying to move forward a week to the day that they'll be fine at what time they find it\nT:\tit's gonna be a four o'clock flight\nC:\tso about what time would you have to leave -\nT:\tI would have to leave probably at 3 o'clock because it's only about 20 minutes to the airport really\nC:\treally\nT:\tbut I would like to leave earlier they're probably taking up time by the time they land and to go through you know they're getting their luggages they probably won't even come out till maybe 4:30 but I'd like to make sure I'm there at around 3:30 4 o'clock\nC:\tall right so let's go to the best day it's good that day and said that afternoon\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso you're still at home and let's say we're about 15 minutes before you have to get in the car what are you thinking then\nT:\tI have to do this to to get up and go they need me to be there this this week it's my parents coming in and they're elderly so I don't want them to be stuck at the airport there's no one else that actually can go pick them up so I have to get up and go and pick them up so\nC:\tthat's going here\nT:\tthat is what's going through my mind that you know there's nobody else that can do this I mean it's cheaper than there's nothing I can't probably can't even afford to get a taxi for them because you'd have to cross that's from Philly to into New Jersey so that's gonna be very expensive I can't afford that when all I'd have to do is pay $5.00 for the tow and maybe gas up my car for $10 or something but hey I'll be thinking about it I have to do this and I'm not really doing it you know it's something that I can save money that way and I don't want to leave them stranded definitely someone else can I mean baby lost they're not familiar with there but in Philly the airport is crazy to me\nC:\tit's a big place a lot going on so so you're sitting at home in 15 minutes before you eat in the car and you're thinking I have to do this but your reasons are positive like you to save money and protect your parents from having to be there alone so ones things I do come in\nT:\tum just the thought of the bridge there it's just I could drive off the bridge you know they can fall off usually what I do is try to stay in the middle lane I can't do more miles an hour and I just I'm shaking I have the radio on and windows down because I can't swim so for any reason I'm to fall off I mean that's it for me I even have a little metal one of those so I think it's an instrument that you used in the house for I don't know pliers or something is something real hard that I can hit the glass with it sits right there on my door so I'm all ready I planned and I have that I planned ahead of time I know what I'm gonna do as soon as I approach the patient but I still feel anxious\nC:\tyou're anxious before you leave and you're and you're starting to think about the bridge at that point we already think about it\nT:\tyes\nC:\thow about when you get your car you start driving toward the bridge say a prayer I'm still anxious I turn on the radio the closer I get to especially the toll points and I know it's at me and you see those lights flashing last exit before you know\nT:\tyou know you're going over one\nC:\tyeah I have no there's no turning back there's no turning back\nT:\tso before that when you can still exit what's your anxiety level\nC:\tbefore when I can still Excel yeah it's probably still high it's about the other than the high nor so it's still high but\nT:\tit's not maxed out yet but every lap\nC:\tit's gonna be\nT:\tyeah I think it's pretty bad at that point\nC:\tand how about when you cross through the that's an inside the tendon okay\nT:\tyes yes\nC:\tso your specific fear as you start to cross this is the bed Frank want to be the first bridge right you can do across is that your car will go off the bridge\nT:\tyes\nC:\tand when does that so that's a 10th anxiety when does that anxiety start to go away\nT:\tas soon as that getting close to getting off the bridge and now leaving that little sigh of relief there's a little release there and I know that I've been able to manage those two three minutes of cross that into how many minutes it takes actually of crossing crossing the bridge and I start feeling a little bit of relief but then again I know I have to do my back exit and there's another one coming by that so starts all over again all\nC:\tright Sonia crossed the second bridge the drug point fridge you go to the airport as your anxiety dropping those points\nT:\tOh as soon as this I'm descending from the Gerrard Point Bridge there's less you know it's almost reduced I'm not coming you know really low it's almost going yes it's not Muskaan\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand when you start thinking about that you're gonna have to cross them again\nC:\tas soon as I'm exit I'm getting back on 95 going north and I know here we go again and cars that zooming by and you know\nT:\tas you're not going to really\nC:\tknow I'm that person into the middle lane doing 40 miles an hour yes\nT:\tall right so you're you're doing everything you can to keep your car on the bridge but you're still feeling anxiety like you're gonna go off the bridge\nC:\tyes the whole the whole time until you start really descending\nT:\texactly\nC:\tand then you feel like you've made it\nT:\tyes especially when there are those big trucks tractor trailers coming\nC:\tdoes the air\nT:\tyes yes if it's also in bad weather or at night it's worse because on the bridge especially the top one you kind of see the sky and there's nothing else you see so it's like you're gonna fall off yes\nC:\tso in the lower level it's not as bad\nT:\tall the lower level coming back it's not as bad because you're kind of like protected here and there so it's not as bad but going is definitely worse yes\nC:\tare you aware of any time a car will gone off the bridge\nT:\tI hear all the news once in a while you'll hear something happen or sometimes in movies you see things happen I think it's possible\nC:\tit's possible do you think it's a high risk\nT:\tno maybe none of that um Girard bridge because I I noticed I was checking it the other day I had to go to the airport and I was trying to measure the distance between the metal poles just to see if a car could fit there really and I think a car could fit there but you know it just depends on the angle you were hit or something or if you flipped so yeah done some thinking she's\nC:\tdone some calculations geometry right and you've concluded that it's not really likely but it could all right so but either way your anxiety is maxed out on each bridge now when you get home I mean get your parents back to you take them back to your house\nT:\tyes\nC:\tand you feel them\nT:\tI don't even recall all the anxiety know why it was such a big deal anyway I don't think about it at all\nC:\tall right so you when you arrived home you're down to one\nT:\tyes yes\nC:\tall right so going back to the the first stage like when you're getting ready you're thinking that you have to go\nT:\tyes\nC:\tand it would save your parents money\nT:\tit would save me money how it can be the one calling the can but if people want to pick them up and save them from being stranded at the airport than being in a land that they they're not familiar with an area they're not familiar with so make sure that they're safe\nC:\thow important is their safety to you know very important yes\nT:\tso it clearly it sounds like you picked them up before\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso picking them up is it's worth all the anxiety\nC:\tit's worth but yes it's\nT:\ttough\nC:\tit's still something that bothers me that I have to do yeah it's worth the inside\nT:\tthat's worth it but you wish that you could do it without anxiety\nC:\tyes I wish there was another route that I could take any bridges at all that's not known yet defined yeah\nT:\tand how long have you had that anxiety we try to approach it\nC:\tas long as I can remember that I know maybe even that when I was younger but perhaps as a mother and you know someone as I got that life was important I mean prior to maybe marriage and kids\nT:\tall right developed along the way somewhere it's been with you ever since\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso I'd like to do what kind of therapy we call a refrain and actually you've kind of already done it but I want to make it a little clearer so you suffer things I D and you suffer it to protect mostly protector your parents\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso as you're going over the bridge you're thinking about the automatic thought we talked about these before right the thought that kind of pops in your mind is I'm gonna fly off the bridge\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso that seems pretty unlikely all right that's not something that maybe as you talk about geometrically maybe there's some way your car could find the bridge with physics now maybe could happen but it seems like it would be do you fairly like\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso you could challenge that and this isn't the refrain part but you could challenge that on that thought which with a statement and adapt a response like it's pretty unlikely I think it's going to happen alright that might help a bit to keep applying then the chances are vastly in your favor I could sing how many cars you cross that bridge I'm a fly off the bridge alright heard of plan out for those bridges but the other you know the refrain part is that you're you're doing this you're willing to take on the bridges and have this anxiety for the betterment of your parents for their safety\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso in this whole equation of crossing bridges and anxiety and you're really really the good guy in this you're you're willing to you're willing to suffer and overcome a fear to make sure your parents are saying yeah I mean and you've thought about before like before you leave you think I only have to pick a month but you've never really connected it to want to be in the good guy here\nC:\twell yeah\nT:\tokay does that make sense\nC:\tyes it does it does yes like here go my guess my family size my brothers and sisters appreciate that yes\nT:\tyeah you've overcome it before to pick them up and when you pick up again you'll you'll overcome it again and you'll suffer but I the difference here is that that reframe I want you to apply that reframe when you're feeling that anxiety issue get ready to leave and as you're trapped with the bridge that you're really you know you're doing what you feel is right for the good of your family\nC:\tyes\nT:\tall right so the automatic thought that's gonna come in in is you're gonna fly off the bridge okay that's what that's what the exoti is about Miss Spears and the reframe in this case the reframe adapter response is I'm doing I'm doing this for my family and the probabilities preloaded like the bridge that's a separate thing but the reframe is I'm no I'm the hero of this I think that's a great way to look at here to hear of this situation\nC:\tso think of that terms at the beginning of that day or they went up to hold\nT:\tthe whole day yeah yeah just kind of go over that should rather than like something you must do because really you don't have to do it strictly speaking right I know you feel you have to do it but you're willing to do it you're willing to sacrifice and suffer to do it\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand I'd rather that be the theme that you're getting is a positive thing that you're that you're willing to do it has to be done it's uncomfortable you'll survive it it's uncomfortable I focus on that kind of reframe then focusing on the very low probability that you're the risk that you're going to fly off the bridge so it's very low low risk\nC:\tokay look uh make\nT:\tsense and\nC:\tmake sense and make sense\nT:\tso it's not so much being forced to do it me forced into an extra situation you're voluntarily in brave and I know it's hard it's hard for you didn't use your say it's a 10 on the anxiety to get that's that's the highest score right so it's hard for you but the way to look at it maybe would be you're doing has to be done you to flee go your family they need you have you ever had any close calls on a bridge or anything\nC:\tum when it there was that day when there was a lot of thunderstorm and there was wind so I could literally feel the car shaking on the bridge and there was a day I think I was coming into Delaware I had to stop and call those they say if you need help crossing the bridge and I stopped and call them but they talked me before they talk to me for about half an hour or so and then they told me that it would take another hour for someone to literally be able to come and get me and this was like that I was leaving here it was self probably around 10:00 10:30 class was over I was on the bridge and it was late at night raining and I just I couldn't do it but after a while I think I calmed down with their conversation and I was able to just take it easy in that middle lane she always managed to overcome\nT:\tyeah and that might be another a good automatic thought or adaptive response to that on that thought is that I've always managed overcome this and it hurts but managed overcome it\nC:\tyes\nT:\tI kind of taken charge like that and being assertive that might help reduce that automatically\nC:\tok\nT:\tyou think if you try that this time is you\nC:\tthat's thinking in that positive way I've done this before and then that can do it again\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tall right all right\nT:\tso I'll see you again in two weeks which will give an opportunity\nC:\tto pick them up from me you're quite a bit\nT:\tand then we'll see how things start with that and we'll move from there\nC:\tokay\nT:\tall right thanks sweetie\nC:\tthank you very much\n",
  "T:\tso I'm hearing the good part about drinking is that it keeps you calm and I'm also hearing the downside about it is that you started wanting spenders and your family get a bit concerned it must be tough so what is that like for you\nC:\ta little bit down and or Danika really pick-me-up is a good drink\nT:\tyeah so you kind of use it as a way to shift your mood a little bit yeah okay and so what what do you what would you like to do what would you like to change\nC:\tI don't like the way that makes everybody feel when I get overly intoxicated so I feel like I need to just find another way I need to stop\nT:\tokay so you noticing that it's kind of a little too long and so you want to find an alternative means of coping or trying to relax\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay and what are some alternatives\nC:\twell my buddy from work told me about some places that might be able to help me with some some strategies around giving up drinking\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tthought about going back to church\nT:\tso on a scale of zero to 100 how important do you think it is for you to make this change\nC:\tI know it's it's it's clearly above 50% I feel like if I don't stop just now end up in a grave somewhere so I need to take this\nT:\tokay so around 50 and on a scale from zero to 100 100 how confident are you in making this change\nC:\tI've tried before maybe a day or two and then something really bad happened or things got tough and I just went right back to drinking\nT:\tthe good side of it is that you understand that you need help and I think that's awesome really really good for you to have that insight so I'm hearing that you're not that confident okay so from from 0 to 100 where are you\nC:\tI'm gonna be in less than 50% because I have been way too long without drinking uh sometimes when I work I think about getting off just to have that one\nT:\tso in terms of importance you're around 50 in terms of confidence it's less than 50 so I'm hearing that it's important you know that it's important for you to make that change but in terms of confidence you're not that confident okay so what do you think it would take to help build that confidence\nC:\twell I live alone really have anybody that comes and shakes on me so\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tmaybe if I had somebody you know take your time to check on me\nT:\tright right\nC:\tfind out how I'm doing every now and again that might keep me encouraged\nT:\tso I'm hearing that you you would like someone to help keep you accountable and also to help encourage you and motivate you towards making this change and and this is the reason why you mentioned your belief system before and if I if it's okay if I may ask your permission what the people at your church be some of the people that you can turn to for some of the the accountability and you know help motivate you to change\nC:\tI guess that's what church is for I've been in church since I was a little boy I don't know that that's where you go to get right so all of you are the right people\nT:\tright so I hear you say I want to get right and I kind of hear that willingness to want to change can you tell me 103 best reasons for you to make this change\nC:\tshe's always telling me I don't need to drink she doesn't want me to hurt myself I see how makes me feel when I drink I'm usually in the rut I feel good terrible again I just want to do I want to go out and achieve some things in life change this\nT:\tokay so some of the things I'm hearing is that you might want to do it for your mother and I'm hearing that you would want to achieve this you're maturing on in life and so for you and what's another one\nC:\tjust thinking oh maybe I'll grow healthier tonight some that drink as much quartz I drank it all\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tpeople you know they don't drink and they seem to be really healthy\nT:\tuh-huh\nC:\tso maybe I maybe I can be that one day\nT:\twalk me through a day of drinking for you\nC:\twell not working\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI wake up in the morning and I usually try to fix myself some some breakfast but I end up drinking a little bit because I keep a little something\nT:\tokay\nC:\tbut by the middle of the day I find that I'm really loose after having a few drinks and I say a lot of terrible things I don't recall it in in particular but I've been recorded and friends have told me you know things that I've said under the influence and it really rowdy anything I'm taking out nobody when I'm when I'm drinking then I get kicked out of places\nT:\tyeah yeah\nC:\tI can drive and\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tit's just not it's not the way I want to live it's I feel too dependent upon having the right drink\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tit can't be empty and\nT:\tsome hearing when you wake up you've had a drink in the morning right before breakfast\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand by that time you're calm and you're loose and anything you just get a little belligerent okay it's causing you to get kicked out a lot of places you know and I'm hearing them you're saying that that's no way to live and so you no longer want that yeah and the good the good thing about what I'm hearing is that you have friends\nC:\tyes\nT:\twell care enough to notice what's going on and bring it to your attention by recording you\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand so when you see yourself\nC:\tI feel I feel bad sometimes we make fun of me because my buddies dream today drink yeah but not unlike me I'm the worst on everyone and they can take it in to have one beer be done and me I'll just keep going everybody goes home and you know it's just me\nT:\tand something your buddies have in common right\nC:\tyeah but they I think they're just seeing me in a different way when it went out I've hurt so many people\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tand I just don't want to do it anymore they told me I mean oh and I believe our new home\nT:\tyeah\nC:\teverybody's saying that he helps or I must I must in Galax\nT:\tyeah and so help is available I have a few substance abuse places that I'd like to refer you to and maybe some hey have you heard of alcohol Anonymous meetings as we mentioned before support group and your church as you mentioned so these are the avenues that you said you would like to go into\nC:\tI mean sounds alright I don't want to feel like I don't have control\nT:\tright\nC:\tI don't want to feel I don't want to drink I want help I just don't want to feel like I'm trapped in one particular program I mean they do make community do these guys helped me to find strategies\nT:\tabsolutely absolutely it definitely helped me with strategies and you know a lot of affirmation and helping you to get there control that you said that you wanted these are definitely some and great place is to go into to help you get your life back sound like what I'm hearing you say\nC:\tyes good\nT:\tokay so we've talked about where you are in terms of wanting change we talked about where you act as far as feeling confident in change we also discussed a little bit about the reasons why you want to change the three reasons you mentioned your mom you mentioned for yourself you mentioned your health in the session we also discussed some avenues that you may take in terms of getting that support that you want we talked about your belief system a little bit we talked about church we talked about referrals in places that you may be interested in so you talked about a lot and I want to hear from you how is this going for you how how was the session been going for you in the past the last session that we had before\nC:\tI mean our key I came back because the first time I spoke to you you didn't judge me\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou didn't tell me I was some scumbag whose side of the road you told me I needed a clean up because I'm a junkie so I came back and you've made it very easy for me to speak to you and that's the only reason because everybody else talks to me but they they talk down to me and I don't like that and not feel ashamed of myself but speaking to you telling me I understand I can get man up and I can do something different nothing regain my self-confidence\nT:\tyeah well thank you I'm glad that you have had a wonderful experience in terms of speaking with me

and schedule those referrals\n",
  "T:\thi nice cute\nC:\tyou two\nT:\tso why don't you tell a little bit about yourself\nC:\tso when it was Kelsey Harris I am a student here I'm a senior double majoring tiger balm on campus I play a sport I do collectivities home very busy around campus from with your lineup I was born and raised here so I like beyond my family a lot\nT:\tjust sounds like you're really busy all the time yeah\nC:\tyeah you can say that you got home a lot\nT:\tum actually no not really I only live a couple hours away but my parents come here not frequently but enough that i get to see them so you say they play basketball\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyes\nC:\tyes so walgreens whopping two-year like what you decide\nT:\twell I've been struggling with some anxiety issues lately and I can't seem to figure out why I just I've been having some like anxiety attacks and panic attacks just wasn't like the last couple months and I thought him just go away on their own and like they think has come on at night sometimes or at first I thought they were centered around like papers and normal collops things but then like I had one were fall break whenever I didn't have anything to do looking to be here\nC:\thave you so you see that it has nothing to do with schoolwork because you said you have a really cool place and you don't think I hadn't anything to do it back\nT:\tI don't think into this and I mean it's a big school of constant thing so it's my senior year or two and I had to pop up until now so I I don't know I can't really figure out what could be causing it\nC:\thow are things at home with your family\nT:\tI'm dinner going well my little sister actually she's a freshman in college this year so my parents are at home with the emptiness and trying to figure out what i'm going to do with their free time and call me a lot i went off a lot but I mean everything's fine I see my grandparents pretty often my sister is going well\nC:\tthat's good so so you and your family are going well\nT:\twe're we ever pretty close\nC:\thow I was like the social life like how are things at school you know with your friends and ball how are things going\nT:\tsocially everything is going well too just trying to keep everything balanced it's a but I mean I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job of it\nC:\tyou get very clean school and stuff\nT:\tyeah and i will say that senior year brings you know the senioritis around sometime so it's hard to get some motivation in there but um I mean schools would well like I I'm happy with my grades are socially I'd say that I mean my friends are still there like I love my friends I'm i feel like i do the same things that is nothing different going on\nC:\tokay\nT:\tsocially I\nC:\tjust just get anxiety attacks just randomly\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tdo you notice any pattern maybe when things id attack occurs\nT:\tso I had probably five or six within the past month a couple of them happen at night only who actually most only the only one happy birthday but I wasn't like around anybody see any patterns with that at a loss\nC:\tbut he had any strange or reoccurring dreams\nT:\tum actually I have they're just been like weird dreams that it's like I don't know it kind of plays on the future a lot but then like whenever i wake up i can't remember like specific details from it like you have you had a dream where you it feels so really you wake up and you Cameron really what just happened\nC:\tyeah that's usually how you know it works a lot of people put a note pad next to their their bed and the second they wake up they write down what they dreamt about so they don't forget and like it's just something that people do but maybe that's something that you can try oh my good yeah so you say your sister her brother\nT:\tsister\nC:\tjust left home why she going to school\nT:\tshe is in school at Spelman in Atlanta so she is having fun hopefully studying oh no she's not playing sports she just ran their students\nC:\tshe's a regular student\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know how many thousand things on your plate like you did\nT:\tyeah I was I don't know cuz every time I talk to her she's like like they have a lot of going on down there Nixon is it Lana like it's my Burlington North Carolina so I talked to her I'm like when you ever study I don't really you know every time I talk to your do it comes you too jealous but we should\nC:\tyeah okay so when you have anxiety like wouldn't have these attacks like what are you feeling\nT:\tI feel like scared I feel almost like a pressure like I can't breathe you type of thing but more like a scared feeling\nC:\tdo you feel helpless\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyeah what do you thought\nT:\twell the first time it happened like I never had before so I didn't know what's going on and I was like in my room just about a little bit not doing anything in particular so the first time it really scared me and then you know it took me a few seconds just like started reading my guardian graduate and then a house wine so I think the more they happened I hope they will just call myself down and just keep going few minutes later and not think about it but I don't want them to keep all right well\nC:\tthat's good that you're about to keep my calm yourself down and that's good have you talked to any of your friends about it\nT:\tno\nC:\tit's the first time you're talking about it\nT:\tyeah I've seen any doctor like I don't have a weird thing with like taking medicine everything I want to be supplied with always like home\nC:\tjust type in it\nT:\tyeah I feel dependent on medicine\nC:\tyeah I feel the same way uh okay so how would you toss the team looking this year how's the basketball team looking\nT:\treally good um I want to seniors on the team so everybody's looking up to me so it's a little bit of pressure but i like i like it it's different you know our team's different\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's it's hard to compare this team to like other years and I mean it's kind of like unknown going into it just like you have a heavy patient because there's young you know two layers yeah we were going you taking my captain girl you'd say that oh just stepping into whatever goal the coaches want me in want me to 70 keep me like I'm trying to be a leader like vocally and it's different for me because I'm not used to being so vocal about it\nC:\tso you feel a pressure a little bit this year\nT:\tI can just always pressure there but I guess it's like a little more pressure just because he had a lot of the\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tone of the few seniors\nC:\tok so\nT:\tthe pressure is good though no yeah\nC:\tyeah actually I agree um and then so with school are you feeling any pressure there\nT:\tum I guess not I think about it I mean I am a little bit um so like my GPA is it's pretty good I have a like 33 I'm pretty close till you at 36 Soleil I'm trying to keep it up like a 35 the rest of the year and we depart of zoo but doesn't aiming for yeah so yeah yeah but it's all like a pressure go myself like nobody's really like telling me I have to do it just for or else but it's just something that kind of doing\nC:\tso are you are you a leader in your sorority any kind like you have actually there\nT:\twell I'm the treasure in my sorority but we we had a lab new members come in last year some kind of like showing them the ropes kind of likes taking steps back you know like them starting to read some things so it's not really that much pressure in that\nC:\tbut it sounds like you a lot to do\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tBilly today\nT:\tyeah I think I'd rather do that then have so much free time\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI'll have to do is probably sleep it like egg sleep or watch TV you know or Netflix\nC:\toh okay so I want to hear more about you know your family

personalization\nT:\tit's almost like I can see myself having it like\nC:\tyou like it sever\nT:\tyeah but I know exactly what you need\nC:\thow about a fear of losing control or going crazy Eric you were worried about diamonds this happen so within but like following all these attacks have you ever worried about what we'll call these attacks have you worried about having another one and that's led to another attack\nT:\tyeah yeah like that's why you know I was packing up my gym bag and then I thought about how it happened and you know like was thinking about doing the you know the spinning class that brought it on so I didn't even pack up my gym bag that I was sitting there and I had like my shorts and got even just thinking about it it was you know yeah I started freaking out right there my bedroom with my bag open\nC:\tsometimes it is attacks are brought on by worrying about another attack\nT:\toh yeah completely\nC:\tand you and you mentioned before that you kind of you're avoided to go into the why in efforts reduce the billion attack\nT:\tyeah you know what it's really embarrassing but I don't even drive on Market Street because you know my husband was driving down Market Street and one started and you know it's really embarrassing yeah there's some things that I'm not doing it all but it's it's getting in the way\nC:\tit's really interfering to life yeah\nT:\tthis information has been really helpful I appreciate\nT:\tY\nC:\tit's good to see you today\nT:\tnice to see you\nC:\tthe last time we met we're talking about in the session how it appeared like you had panic disorder right you had talked about not quite to the Y anymore and and the some episode you mentioned on Market Street when you're in your car and there's there's a kind of embarrassing for you to talk about appreciate you having courage to to describe the symptoms to me they sound you sound horrible the chest pain I'm sorry you're going through that we're gonna try to help you I want to ask you a few more questions try to clarify what's going on that's okay so I'm wondering you talked about the Marcus Street in the Y and I want to ask you some questions the sky relates not just to the episodes but just to your life in general\nT:\tokay\nC:\tlike these items are gonna ask you\nT:\tokay\nC:\thave you have you noticed in the sense you had the onset of you know what you're probably panic disorders we talked about so last night one city noticed a fear of using public transportation all did you ever use public transportation we start with\nT:\tI did to do the bus to work sometimes know if I if I take the bus I mean what if that happens on the bus more am I gonna go\nC:\tdo an escape\nT:\tyeah I'm scared\nC:\tokay how about being an open spaces in general when parking lots right\nT:\tyeah like really freaky\nC:\tyeah okay that brings up worry and anxiety for you\nT:\tI can feel the heartbeat actually yeah I haven't yeah that's become from\nC:\tokay how the opposite have a being in enclosed spaces like a crowd of people waiting in line\nT:\tout but when I was at the mall with my husband and we were in line I could definitely feel it you know actually you know what we put our stuff down and I didn't even buy it we left\nC:\tsimilarly standing in line being a crowd\nT:\tyeah we've been doing a lot of it but yeah hope being outside alone in general that's been taking\nC:\tI haven't been going a lot you know if my husband goes with me you know maybe if my friend goes but yeah\nT:\tthat sometimes helps if you have something else with you\nC:\tif I have to do\nT:\tokay when you find yourself out in crowds and close spaces and open places what response you're having like what's what's happening when you're out there sight let's just use for example a crowd at the mall\nC:\tokay well at first like I noticed that my heart was pounding you know and then I noticed that it was hard to breathe and then I started thinking about the last time it happened and I was like oh my god it's gonna happen again and then I've got to get out of there if I can get out before oh my god even thinking about it right now like\nT:\teven seeing it with me it's a scary thing for his fearful\nC:\tyeah I didn't want to come out you know Joe's in the waiting room you know I can't even come here by myself\nT:\tit's getting away of your life yeah and you're potentially in treatment I'm glad you did he did come do you think that the response you're having does seem to match a danger level around you like you feel like the most dangerous or the spaces of danger so you think about logically\nC:\tlike if I'm thinking about it right here with you\nT:\tyeah like it feels it feels that way\nC:\tyeah I think about logically it isn't no it's not how many years of my life did I go to the mall and I was fine\nT:\tyou mentioned this we call for nine months yeah it does seem like it's getting in the way of your life do you have any severe or moderate medical conditions how are you physically\nC:\twell I had a cold in September this information has been really helpful in my creation\n",
  "T:\thi Dina\nC:\thi\nT:\tI'm hailing the dietitian how are you\nC:\there real\nT:\tgood how you doing today\nC:\thow are you\nT:\tdo you want to speak to me?\nC:\tjust not diagnosed with these I'm really confused and concerned so the doctor said that I should come see you some help\nT:\tyeah absolutely um do you know what type\nC:\t1 diabetes\nT:\tso basically what type 1 diabetes is it's a condition where our body stops production on the hormone called insulin and what influences for our body is it helps to convert food which is converted to sugar into energy for ourselves so let me show you an example let's say that this is ourselves and this is glucose so what food breaks down now our cells will need you to glucose as of energy but glucose can't get into it so it's insulin acts as a hormone open up your cells the cause of the glucose and that is how it's used for energy and this energy is what we use in everyday life like thinking talking moving things like that so without insulin your body isn't able to get the glucose into ourselves so this caused us a lot of problems so with that we have conditions like hyper let's eat yet which is what we have too much glucose in the body and that's off hypoglycemia which is what we have not and this is kind of the bounce we could try to face when it comes to type 1 diabetes so it's really important to monitor and make sure that we keep the blood glucose levels or sugar intact so do you have any questions so far?\nC:\tno no\nT:\tokay great so did your doctor talk to you anything about insulin or taking insulin\nC:\the prescribed me for what he sounds a fast-acting insulin and that I should take it before you\nT:\tokay so today we're actually going to talk about different ways that you can meet and how we can work with your diet and foods would eat with the insulin you're gonna take it so we're gonna talk about carbohydrate counting which I'll explain in a second we're also gonna talk about portion sizes come we're also gonna talk about timing and his estate meals especially when it comes to taking insulin so before we start I asked you did you forget any food items in today\nC:\tI brought some macaroni cheese delicious\nT:\tokay awesome so when it comes to carbohydrate crowning we always want to make sure that we're aware of the carpod so if you know what a carbohydrate is\nC:\tthe star chips my prey like bread rice pasta\nT:\tabsolutely so do like\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay great so when it comes to carbohydrates there's also different types of carbohydrates in foods like ice cream or milk or some of our vegetables actually contain carbohydrates just sometimes not so much but they still contain a little bit some carbohydrates so let's look at this so when it comes to looking at nutrition labels we want to make sure that we're counting the total amount of carbohydrates per serving so when we account for carb exchange we like to think of 15 grams of carbohydrate equals one carb exchange and we want to make sure especially we type 1 diabetes that were laundering that especially with the influent we're taking so when it comes to 15 grams per one exchange how many carbons changes do you think are in one serving of the second cheese\nC:\tokay serving 47 grams\nT:\tyeah that's great that's awesome um that's exactly right and it's also good that you've rounded an off so you know kind of exact or estimates of how many cars you do so it's really good to be aware of that now is there any other foods that you brought in today\nC:\tyeah in my morning cereal\nT:\tI'm seeing great great so based off the serving size of one cup how many karbix changes do you see\nC:\tokay so there's 42\nT:\tyeah absolutely so that's great so making sure that you're aware of that it's awesome and it's really beneficial especially we know where again how many so great I also looked at your 24-hour recall and I wrote down some items that you ate during dinner and this was the nutrition facts for them and one of them is the avocado chicken salad from Panera and the pizza field corazon you had so based on the nutrition label how many total carbs that they have for each one\nC:\tokay there is 7 grams carbohydrate in avocado chicken salad and 15 grams of carbohydrates in the real one\nT:\tokay great that's awesome um when it comes to the avocado chicken salad there tends to be a low amount of carbohydrates because of the vegetables but also being aware that chicken and fat don't contain any carbohydrates so it's really important for the constitute exchanges that you're aware of kind of how fat doesn't have any carbs but to gain consideration why do you think the veal parmesan has 15 grams of carbohydrate yeah that's that's awesome you made the distinction so yeah I'm just making sure when you check your salads or you're checking your meat that there's no there is if they're just start to comes out as a card exchange or you kind of do it so that's great do any questions okay great so going forward I wanna ask you a little bit about portion sizes so when it comes to portion sizes this goes hand-in-hand with carbohydrate counting does you want to know how many portion sizes you have to avoid if you're overeating or knowing coming cartilage so going with that we like to do a hand method which is about one fistful is about one cup of vegetables or rice or pasta and this is a good measurement of kind of how many carbs are so for example if you have one cup of pasta that would be three cartridges because 1/3 of a cup of pasta is what carb exchange so just being aware of that same with rice and also with vegetables it's great because 1/2 a cup is only eventual exchange but there's very little carbohydrates so you all have to really worry about how much I'm one cup of script so using the hand method is a really great way of pushing out so I wanted to ask you face off of the cereal how many this amount of cereal\nC:\tso I'm gonna make my fist looked a little bigger than my fist so I take about a cup and a half so since one cup is three carbs exchanges\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tit would probably be a little bit more than three exchanges\nT:\tgreat great that's awesome so that's a really good method you can use we also like to use again with the hand method something that you can look at is three ounces of a meat or chicken is about the size of your palm and for fat from the top of your thumb to the bottom of it is about one tablespoon so that can be considered of that exchange as well so we can go look at that so great I'm so glad that so going off of that when it comes to consume meals and timing of meals it's really important when especially when you're taking fast acting insulin because what happens is when you take insulin you're supposed to be eating 15 minutes before after you take your insulin so it to make sure that works and that you don't go into a state of hyper will say I see though cuz you're not eating any good though so it doesn't so it's really important to so I want to ask you because I know you have a really really busy day because you are working at the shop that you say yeah we work that and that normally you don't have time for breaks and stuff like that so I want to ask you what time of the day you can would be a good way to add meals or snacks to your everyday schedule\nC:\twell I don't really eat so maybe in between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner preferably Porsche\nT:\tgreat great because that's actually a great record bomb great suggestion because it's really important especially because you want to make sure that your glucose cells are intact that you're eating less than four hours in between meals so a lot of times people tend to eat either three big meals or they tend to eat six small meals so whatever you want you choose that go as well with your work schedule totally up to you just making sure that you're monitoring it and making sure you're taking it with your insulin before time so going with that I wanted to ask you at four o'clock so what kind of needles are doing at that time because that's really\nC:\twell that's right before I go in to teach my class so nothing too big maybe just like banana\nT:\tokay um it's not a realistic goal for you do you think you will have trying to eat that's not during that period of time\nC:\tyeah just something smaller\nT:\tokay absolutely so when it comes to bananas this is specially really important roots are also considered a carbohydrate exchange about 1/2 a cup and we time to think of a banana one full exchange so just letting you know that a half a cup which is about a half a banana it's one carbon straight so if you're eating one full banana it's considered to carb exchanges but throughout this whole process you'll learn a lot about different kinds of exchanges and how to tell which one some people get really really good at it so and if you have any questions you go that way so going on is there any other areas of improvement you would like to do for snacking or anything like that\nC:\tI feel like I just need to get in a routine and start snacking more so I can keep consistent\nT:\tokay so where's another time of day where you would like to add back\nC:\twell I do have a light breakfast and then I don't eat till lunch so probably in between there\nT:\tokay what time we thinking about\nC:\t10:00\nT:\tokay and what kind of sweets do you like to eat during that time or like in the morning\nC:\tin the mornings I can't really do anything too sweet so maybe some vegetables\nT:\tvegetables what kind of apples do you like\nC:\tlike carrots celery I love cucumbers\nT:\tokay so would you like to have what kind of snacks would you like two halves would you like I like to have a little vegetables or what are you looking for when it comes ideally\nC:\tyeah well I need something fast and on the go because I'm always moving I'm always going around I don't really have time to sit and settle and eat\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso I need stuff that packages easily that I can just take with me\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso there's actually I don't know if you heard but we have these I grocery stores sometimes they have these great snack packs so sometimes they come with like a little bit of hummus and vegetables do you like oh well it's something you can definitely try or what do you think of like peeler perfect so peanut butter no vegetables I'll be great for the morning so that's great they made that connection that's awesome these are really great changes and we definitely I'm really excited to work with this with you so that's not the time we have today but before we leave I have these handouts for you so this is another alternative method instead of the hand method but it's a really great way of planning so that half your plate being notables 1/4 being starch and another fourth being meats and there's also a method we talked about the portion sizes and a little meals to calm pattern and before you leave I also want to ask you what did you learn today\nC:\tso I learned a lot of carb exchanges and to really watch those method which is one cup one meat portion and your Samus fat okay and then also just about really spreading out my food and working to eat more consistently\nT:\tokay and I have a quick quiz for you what does fifteen grams of carbohydrates equal\nC:\toneexchange\nT:\tperfect and what is one banana equal to\nC:\tgo to exchanges\nT:\tcorrect that's awesome I'm really excited to work with you but I also have this great information about type one diabetes so it will tell you about different kinds of carbohydrates are considered like breads what we're talking about that milk fruit and sweets also why it's important and also there's a little list over here which is a food journal that you can use so for the next few days or the next month I would really like for you to see what kind of changes you're making and what kind of goals you would like to set to move forward especially when it comes to your meals so just write them down and I plan to meet with you in about a month so we can talk about your\n",
  "T:\tOh so how are you today\nC:\tnot bad I guess Thanks pretty good actually yeah\nT:\twell let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones\nC:\tno no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so so\nT:\twell you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso I wondered it to get started if as a few things that we just lay out before we get going\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and I do want to point out that anything that you say to us will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly I do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that that it sounds as though you rather put yourself at risk imminent risk or putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that\nC:\tokay\nT:\tis there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about\nC:\tno I I understand it sounds good I mean I understand so yeah yeah\nT:\twell there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here\nC:\twell I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of gotten myself into some trouble because because of that\nT:\ttell me more about that\nC:\twell I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous sir\nT:\tsure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this\nC:\tyeah okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome\nT:\tso quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities\nC:\twell yeah yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well I mean my wife gets upset about that and dicky so\nT:\tcould you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you\nC:\twell the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of little bit down because of that and I thought you know my friend's been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much\nT:\tso you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much\nC:\tyeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you I've been I've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and\nT:\ttime back on the cold\nC:\twell\nT:\tyou've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now\nC:\twell I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control\nT:\tout of control\nC:\tyeah I know some people that are are worse than me\nT:\tbut thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things\nC:\tI guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke and and well okay I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the backseat and and the driver had done kind of the same thing you know he'd done some coke and some booze and and it was is it was pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so\nT:\tso the sliding it's very scary\nC:\tyeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day I mean and I don't even remember\nT:\tso it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things\nC:\tyeah I guess not remembering this has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and and and you know this is gonna sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my Facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them so\nT:\tso quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you\nC:\tyeah yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really gonna regret\nT:\tyour family your wife your friends are all really important to you\nC:\tvery very important\nT:\tthinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious\nC:\twell I mean eight I don't know a you know eight out of ten if that's you know\nT:\tthat makes a lot sense\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay now so you're roughly eight\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four\nC:\twell I guess because it's been been causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and and\nT:\tit's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing\nC:\tyeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand I'm because it's it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine\nT:\tso and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work\nC:\tI be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that and\nT:\tI guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it\nC:\tWow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that\nT:\tit's it's surprising\nC:\twell you know see the thing is is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and\nT:\twhat else do you make of it\nC:\twell I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and he ain't gonna be the beer I guess\nT:\tso for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine\nC:\tit's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine mix like you say they do it and all that\nT:\tso thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I won't know confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident\nC:\twell I mean I'm be honest is yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe four\nT:\tfour\nC:\tmaybe maybe five four I don't know like yeah\nT:\tfour so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one\nC:\tI sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess\nT:\tso a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop\nC:\twell yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them I suppose\nT:\tso there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them\nC:\tyeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available\nT:\tand these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work\nC:\tokay yeah that's okay\nT:\tyeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent users you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you you\n",
  "T:\tBarbara Roberts\nC:\tyes\nT:\thello there my name is dr. Bedi I'm one of the new GPS in the practice first of all what would you like me to call you\nC:\twell you can call me Barbara that'll be fine\nT:\tokay that's fine okay so Barbara I'm seeing you today but I think it'\nC:\ts usually dr. Brown that's seeing she was that right\nT:\tyes dr. Brown's my doctor okay what is it that's brought you to see me today\nC:\twell I've come about my tummy problem I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it and I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help all\nT:\tright okay can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems\nC:\tum well I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time it very often feels bloated I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops it's a real stabbing feeling I often have the urge to go to the toilet and and I pass very smelly wind\nT:\tso quite a few symptoms there and some of them sound quite troublesome to you\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay and how long has this been going on\nC:\twell I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea and and I don't think my stomach's have have been really right since then\nT:\tmm-hmm okay okay so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay and what what sort of treatments have you tried for this before\nC:\twell dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning but I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful they've given me lots of different tablets and medicines\nT:\tright\nC:\tfor different things now or an imodium right I have imodium in my handbag all the time just in case right\nT:\tso these different tablets that you've got from the the herbal shop how are you taking them\nC:\toh well different tablets you know I don't have the same problem every day so I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms\nT:\tright\nC:\tother tablets for other things\nT:\tso my am i right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis and what you're going to take demanding of what your stomach's doing\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay okay and what about tests have you had any tests for these problems\nC:\tyes I had in the early days I had a gastroschisis what are they a\nT:\tgastroscopy\nC:\thow's that the tubes down to the top\nT:\tokay\nC:\tand at the same time I had a barium enema\nT:\tright\nC:\tthat was very uncomfortable\nT:\tokay\nC:\tbut now I've tried what are you I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that that they didn't find anything he's he's just not sent me for any more that's it now as far as he's concerned sent me back to the doctor\nT:\tright sounds as though you're not happy with that\nC:\twell you know I think that actually the NHS is running out of money aren't they and he's decided that I've had enough tests my hand you know if you go on the internet there's loads of tests that he could have said before\nT:\tright\nC:\tif I had a bit more money I'd go private why I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it right\nT:\tso you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way of\nC:\tnotice he's not just loads more he could do I'm sure\nT:\tright okay it sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach you've tried a lot of tablets some prescribed some herbal remedies and you've had some investigations but you're not entirely happy that you even been investigated thoroughly enough is that is that about a toast if I got the story right okay and can ask you Barbara how is all of this affecting you day to day how has it affecting your life\nC:\twhile it's had quite quite big impact I mean the first thing the biggest thing I suppose is that I I went from being full-time to part-time at work I just couldn't sit all day comfortably and so in part-time but in the end I thought how about a year ago I stopped work altogether\nT:\tright\nC:\tand I miss that I miss the girls we used to used to go out at least once a week night to the pictures or Pro drink that's one thing\nT:\tthough about something you quite enjoyed\nC:\tyes\nT:\tall right\nC:\tyes yes we just have a laugh right okay I used to go to swing in shape I used to go to an exercise class that was um I missed the exercise actually that was once a week but you know the thing was I wasn't comfortable never felt quite right doing all this exercise I was always worried I was going to be taken short or so I stopped that\nT:\tright\nC:\tum then well my husband I used to go out for meals\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tthat's another thing we don't do anymore now\nT:\tright\nC:\thmm yes quite a few things really\nT:\tyeah it does it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed quite a lot because of these symptoms it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do\nC:\thmm\nT:\tright what is it you'd spend your average day doing now\nC:\twell I put her around the house I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching I've got a bit hooked on daytime television I have to say they draw you in don't they\nT:\tyes sir I do\nC:\tI read a bit the whole magazines but generally I'm at home\nT:\tright okay okay and have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example have there been any times when things have been better for you\nC:\twell last year my son got married and I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't have to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling well enough surprisingly enough I was in good form I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole who are of the wedding but I was in good really good form for that yeah that was a good time\nT:\tright and how were you Tommy symptoms then\nC:\tI hardly noticed them yes it it seemed to clear up\nT:\tnice sounds good right that's interesting hmm and are there any times when you Tommy symptoms bother you more it seemed particularly bad\nC:\tum well it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment it's particularly uncomfortable I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away he he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times a month and that's not it it was very often not good then I have to say why does he\nT:\tnotice it they're worse when your husband's not around mmm\nC:\tmaybe I'm thinking about it a bit more I don't know when he's not there\nT:\tright I know you've been seeing dr. Brown about this for the last few years what is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you\nC:\twell he's he thinks it's all in my head my nose he's yeah he says it's stress why it's okay\nT:\tand what do you think\nC:\twell I mean it can't all be in my head I get too much physical pain or it to be in my head I mean it's real it's it's a real pain\nT:\tmm-hmm and have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it\nC:\twell I mean I I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages but I think I mean sometimes I think it's IBS a friend of Mines got that and it sounds similar and then other times I think I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day I start to think it might be cancer\nT:\tright\nC:\tum my mother-in-law my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a growth that the doctor didn't investigate\nT:\tright\nC:\tbut by the time they'd found it it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate then so you know when I go to bed at night now and I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on\nT:\tright\nC:\tand yeah I worry about that\nT:\tso you're kind of prodding having a feel at night oh you see if you can feel anything\nC:\tyeah I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there you know\nT:\tright okay okay so just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've you've seen dr. Brown for a couple of years you've you've tried a variety of medications some prescribed some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference you've had some investigations but you're perhaps feeling you've not had enough investigations and times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer is that have I got a story right\nC:\tyes yeah I say so\nT:\tokay Bob well what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today\nC:\twell I thought you know you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training I wondered whether you know with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem might you probably know about different tests new tests that my doctor doesn't know about you know new developments all\nT:\tright\nC:\tso perhaps you could send me for some different tests\nT:\tright right so you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests\nC:\thmm well I think this there's got to be something that tests might right reveal\nT:\tright okay well I think Barbara having having heard your story and heard about the symptoms I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you and the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years and they've not shown anything and your symptoms haven't really changed that much so it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know so it would be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests\nC:\tso it's like do you think it's all in my head then you're going to be like dr. Brown you think I'm imagining all of this\nT:\tno I think that you clearly have pain and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they're clearly getting in the way of your life causing you a lot of disability I guess I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body sometimes these things can go together I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and then when your husband's away which is something you don't like very much sometimes somehow is your symptoms then will seem greater so I guess what I'm wondering Barbara is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind and what's going on in your life and and how much you symptoms trouble you do you think that's a possibility\nC:\twell I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain\nT:\tI'm not saying that the pains in your mind I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms given that we've tried medication for you and we've tried investigations and we've drawn a blank really with those none of those have really helped you I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems\nC:\twhat sort of approach\nT:\twell I guess thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years your life has really changed it seems to have really shrunk down and it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of is that right\nC:\twell I just can't do them yeah I can't do them anymore\nT:\tand I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them but I wonder if in a funny way what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you\nC:\toh I don't know I don't know\nT:\tI guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things you know even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth for sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse I guess\nC:\thmm\nT:\twhat would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference\nC:\twell two or three months is a long time if there is something going on I mean that's what happened to my mother-in-law you know they left her and didn't spot it and\nT:\twell I guess if we if we did decide to work together like this in this new approach I'd be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate but if they stay the same then you know we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing now would that sound\nC:\tso what are you saying then that I should come back and see you\nT:\tI think that would be a good idea I think we've only just begun to talk about it and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back perhaps if you booked in for a double slot next week and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach and perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there how would that sound Barbara\nC:\tokay well to make an appointment for next week yeah come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more\nT:\tyes I think so I think that would be a good a good start\nC:\tand I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking yeah I don't bring all the bottles down\nT:\tokay all right okay all right so shows thank you again next week\nC:\tI'll make an appointment for next week illness\nT:\tall right Thank You Barbara\nC:\tokay bye\n",
  "T:\thi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up\nC:\twell I came back here because I had to I had to make an appointment so I could get my prescription for my blood pressure medicine refilled and they wouldn't do it it wouldn't refill it it's a drugstore unless I came back here so\nT:\tyou're you're angry what\nC:\twell I'm not angry at you but I'm angry at the situation and I gotta come back in here take time off from work just to get that prescription filled but but you know you do what you got to do and\nT:\twell I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on\nC:\twell uh yeah whenever I get my blood pressure checked at the drugstore it looks like I'm that it's working and that respect but it does seem to take away all my energy you know\nT:\tkind of fatigued\nC:\tyeah yeah my I got no get up and go if you know what I mean\nT:\tso kind of has taken the wind out of your sails\nC:\tabsolutely yeah\nT:\thow long have you noticed that\nC:\toh I don't know I at least since I've been on this medication at least that long\nT:\tyeah doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular\nC:\toh yeah I take it I take it just like it says take it on the bottle you know I take it every morning when I get up\nT:\tokay so you've been pretty consistent and taken\nC:\tthe all yes\nT:\tanything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for\nT:\tyour wife coming a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you\nC:\twell as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be\nT:\tso sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be\nC:\tnope but I think it's because of that damn medicine\nT:\tso does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively well\nC:\tyeah yeah but you know I I'm worried about my blood pressure because my my mother had a stroke not long ago and I know it was so they told us it was because of her high blood pressure so I don't want that to happen to me\nT:\tso you're concerned about having a stroke\nC:\twell yeah I mean would you be you know it sort of runs in families I think\nT:\tyeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you\nC:\tyeah yeah absolutely\nT:\tagain it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay\nC:\twell are you talking about on more medications or just a different medication\nT:\tyeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary\nC:\tyeah well I'm not real interested in adding any more but if changing it it would keep my blood pressure down but not take away all my energy than I might that give better idea\nT:\tso you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes\nC:\tyeah yeah I know well\nT:\tif it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyeah so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound\nC:\tyeah it sounds though it sounds like a good idea if it still controls my blood pressure but doesn't take away my energy it sounds like a good idea\nT:\tokay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure\nC:\tuh-oh uh-oh my work is sometimes stressful and some of the people I work with kind of drive me a little batty occasionally and I I don't know if it I don't really know if that it causes my blood pressure to go up or not but it certainly could I guess\nT:\tso there's some stressors at work\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of\nC:\tum well you know just mostly from watching TV shows I guess I am aware that alcohol and I drink some a moment that alcohol has some effect on blood pressure I think it might even say so on the label though I'm not sure\nT:\tit can't it can't anything else you can think of\nC:\tno\nT:\twell sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense\nC:\twell yeah\nT:\tso we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but\nC:\twell um exercise I'm I actually like to exercise\nT:\tand tell me about the exercise that you're doing\nC:\twell I play golf and walk the golf course\nT:\tso you carry your bag or do I drag it along on a pull cart\nC:\tmy wife says that that doesn't count as exercise but I say try it yourself it is exercise\nT:\tit is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand you were about 160 or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that\nC:\twell I don't think I'm overweight\nT:\tyeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about 15 to 20 pounds\nC:\t15 or 20 pounds\nT:\tyes 15 or 20 pounds\nC:\tI haven't weighed that since I was in high school\nT:\tI understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose 20 pounds sometimes just a loss of 10 pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso 10 pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable\nC:\t5\nT:\t5 is the number\nC:\tokay\nT:\tlet's go you do with thigh\nC:\tokay I think I can do 5\nT:\tall right so if you were to want to lose 5 pounds how would you go about it\nC:\tI'd probably go back to the gym\nT:\tas that worked in the past\nC:\tyeah I mean I used to go to the gym and work out a lot and uh I've done it for a while but I guess if if I'm I'm sure I could lose 5 pounds if I wanted to\nT:\tand that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure\nC:\tokay well\nT:\tso we've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right\nC:\twell what would it take for me to not have to take the medication at all\nT:\tat all\nC:\tyeah I mean if I did enough exercise and lost enough weight would you not what I not need to take the medicine\nT:\tI I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good I can lose five pounds well it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one 35 to 40 range probably\nC:\tI I just want to make sure I understand if I if if I lose uh five pounds and I do it through exercise that I could you would recommend that I try going without the medicine for a while too and see what happens\nT:\tI don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication\nC:\tyeah if I can yeah\nT:\twell it there it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight to exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis\nC:\ttwo or three beers a day\nT:\ttwo or three\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you\nC:\tyou're saying two or three\nT:\tmore than two more than three\nC:\tokay so two is still considered aa safe and regard to blood pressure\nT:\tthat's what most of the research shows\nC:\tokay I'll do two\nT:\tyou'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day\nC:\tmost every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess\nT:\tcan you think of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis\nC:\toh yeah I guess I could you know I mean uh I you know I don't I I don't have a drinking problem so I could take a day or two and not drink at all if but if if two a day doesn't hurt my blood pressure um I think I could go with that\nT:\tso two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer\nC:\tI suppose I could drink Light beer\nT:\tlight beer doesn't appeal to you\nC:\tmight as well not drink beer at all you drink Light beer but I suppose if I suppose I could do that\nT:\tscale of zero to ten zero being not willing at all to do that ten being very willing to do that where do you think you\nC:\tprobably about it I\nT:\twhy did you say a five and not a three or four\nC:\tjust because uh you know doc habits are hard to break you know and it usually don't drink Light beer and so it would be a change it would be something different but uh well you know I'm willing to give it a try\nT:\ttell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things\nC:\twell I did you know obviously a good thing is I'd probably lose weight which is what we're trying to do here\nT:\tso you'd lose weight\nC:\tuh and there there may be other things about alcohol that has something to do with blood pressure that I did not understand but but I suppose it would help keep my blood pressure down and my weight low or if I didn't drink as much beer or if I drank light beer and so that's the good side the bad side is I don't like it as much\nT:\ton a scale of zero to ten zero being not very important and ten being very important how important is it for you to to get better control of your blood pressure\nC:\tvery important I put that up really pretty high I'll give that a nine\nT:\tso in terms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen\nC:\twell you know I'm willing to do the things but most of what we've just talked about\nT:\twhich are\nC:\tum drinking Light beer drinking no more than two beers a day going to the gym again and sticking with a different medicine for a while\nT:\tokay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go\nC:\tyeah I think I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my blood pressure at a level that doesn't concern me and if this is what it takes I'm going to give this a try\nT:\tso one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that\nC:\tsix and a half\nT:\tsix and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three\nC:\tbecause I know when I walk out of here that if I keep doing what I'm doing I I'm either going to have to live with the blood pressure medicine that takes all my energy away and I don't like that or I'm going to have to let my blood pleasure get real high and I know that can cause all sorts of bad things to happen\nT:\tso you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control\nC:\tpeople keep telling me that high blood pressure causes all sorts of bad things to happen so yes I am concerned about that\nT:\tso if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed\nC:\tfive pounds\nT:\tfive pounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month\nC:\tI'm the five pounds going by then\nT:\tmy pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there\n",

control over 15 years boy but\nT:\tit sounds like you've been working at it but this the years go by it gets pretty pretty frustrating\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand and how um is your weight affecting life for you what's life like sort of where you are\nC:\tum well it crepe lot of pain I'm having problems with my knees recently had knee surgery me so it's really I know the physical pain has shown up that's that's the newest thing you know before it was about what I felt you know what I might look like now it's about how I'm feeling I'm older much older and the pain in my body the sluggishness\nT:\tso as the years have gone by it's it's it's becoming more and more of a problem\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyeah yeah okay and any other sense of how it's affecting the pain course is a very noticeable you know subject but anything else that you experience\nC:\tum like things you're able to do we able to do the same sorts of things well some of that I attribute to age but\nT:\toh yeah right the cardiovascular as well yep\nC:\tyep yep so the biggest one that motivates me is the pain right now because get you away from it\nT:\tand you're in you know that if you lost some weight that then you'd have less pressure on those knees in you can be you\nC:\tcan get around towns would make it too hot you know it doesn't take much just to to feel that difference unfortunately I'm going in the wrong direction\nT:\tyeah well it sounds as though you feel pretty strongly about this that you've been your back in here really wanting us to help you get something going\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso first off I have to hear a ruler rubens and if if you might indicate if you wish from a scale of 0 to 10 just how strong your conviction is about this being a problem you know just as you're describing it the pain and the concerns about your cardiovascular you know all of the ways that it's affecting your life okay from zero that it's really not that much of a problem to 10 this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso where would you put it\nC:\twell I would say that hmm intellectually I'm probably at a nine and physically I'm in the tab\nT:\they all right\nC:\tyep so physically my body telling me every day\nT:\twhy you say\nC:\tmy mind just this needs to be\nT:\tand on what what do you think your mind is you know what the concerns are that your mind has are the are any doubts or anything\nC:\twell I'd say that that it's less because I because of a frustration because it feels like I ok I'm not committing to doing what needs to be done to get rid of the pain and take care of the body so it just doesn't feel like my intellect not knowledge but intellect\nT:\tor emotional baggage with your body\nC:\tyeah or otherwise wouldn't I be doing it\nT:\tyeah it's very close though\nC:\tit's much closer than the business much closer than it's ever been I mean intellectually have been that's what I've been stalling with cuz I've known what to do or thought I knew what to do and I would tinker with it but I didn't make the commitment and now my body says you gotta get it or you're going to be down to the count\nT:\tyeah absolutely um and nine so that's really quite high too\nC:\tokay\nT:\tattends the top of the scale with your body but nine with you not just your thoughts and feelings about it so what makes it a night and not a seven or an eight\nC:\tum the fact that something on my mind every day\nT:\thmm\nC:\tand I know that making the choices is coming up for me I just haven't made the break through like I'll I'll realize that I've done something that was a good back right after the sack yeah I need to realize it before the back and then like could make the change uptake\nT:\tyeah that sounds like that's a source of frustration\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tyeah yeahs\nC:\tout of an internal fight\nT:\tyeah yeah if I could share a perspective that i have about giving what goes on with our mind and our body you'd be interested\nC:\tyo head okay\nT:\twell and this is just my theory but I really has a sense that you know we've got an appetite center in their brain right I'm part of our brain that regulates it might be getting messages about how much energy we have available probably a lot of other things too but basically that's monitoring our body to make sure that we're getting enough nutrition I think one of the challenges as we gradually gained weight and that's what happens with a lot of us know is that over time we gradually gain weight and then we look and we say well this is you know 10 15 20 pounds more than I want to be now but up here okay this this Center in the brain is doing its job of maintaining all those new cells okay you know it's going you know our job two days make sure that everybody gets fed and so we're working against something that's quite automatic in there you know the appetite that we have you know the appetite that we have when we have carb cravings you know I my sense of it is is that that's just something very very automatic Amanda but I also know that it's possible for us to especially someone with a strong conviction that you're demonstrating you know to to really start making some changes so maybe we'll explore for a moment if you like some of the things that you've tried and maybe your sense of what some of the things you you know might might like us to look into it now\nC:\tso i tried the you know looking at diets and of course any of that stuff always leads to putting on more way\nT:\tyep\nC:\tI've turned changing diets I've had major life changes where I'm not working anymore thinking that I would now have all this time to exercise\nT:\tand it's actually a more sedentary\nC:\tyeah especially because they have here i am the less i can move around cuz it's so painful\nT:\tso kind of a vicious cycle\nC:\toh yeah and I was having got diagnosed with severe apnea sleep apnea and learning about all that impacts and now I've been on using machine for about five weeks and I feel the difference both emotionally and physically and they say it takes three to six months to even really i could feel even better than when i'm feeling now so this is definitely the time to make this change they say the lack of sleep to sleep apnea impacts wait\nT:\tI think it does\nC:\tso it's possible that was contributing to my you know to my weight gain\nT:\tyeah absolutely and then even just the factor that the apnea causes you to feel very tired during the day\nC:\toh I told them a larger gym\nT:\tyeah you don't have that energy to beginning of the doing things\nC:\toh just just the diet just so diet and I you know I five books I don't always read them with all the things to get all to try to change my mind around I've television shows about and it saved a lot of research wow I've done I've done the lazy persons research but but I you know I've been tuned into it and I've tried writing down what i ate didn't last very long\nT:\tcan they keep it rising on us\nC:\tno no I think once i got realized how much i was eating i stopped writing um but yeah well that's really\nT:\tabout it right on that i might share\nC:\tuh-huh\nT:\tif you're interested a book that i read a while back called why french women don't get fat\nC:\toh\nT:\tand our goal isn't to be like french women but there are some things in in the in the diet in or lifestyle in that country that are different than the lifestyle in the united states and seem to contribute to better fitness and not quite so much overweight in the book she is a high school student exchange student going to the US and she encountered chocolate chip cookies and brownies and things could put a lot of weight on her and the amount of time look what just happened that must be must be youtube doing that I've all guys folks um and when she got back to the to France she'd gained a lot of weight went to her family doctor and he suggested that that's the first step getting that making a food log\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tand then the perspective that he used was was to just find what he called the offenders we'd like one or two things that oh hi you know concentrated Swedes or concentrated fat and I see a not happening here then what what comes up driver when it I\nC:\tice cream\nT:\tice cream yep\nC:\tice cream\nT:\tyeah ice cream I think pretty much is at the top of the list for all of us you know I swear that ice cream when I have it it just goes right to my hips you know it doesn't pass go doesn't go like two hundred dollars it just goes right there so have you had you looked into that as a possibility if so i might try to cut back\nC:\toh yeah at times i have but i struggled a little bit recently and I um I was gone through ice cream consistently over a couple we carry then guess what my week when I just get so single-minded in focus that's when I go into the grocery store that's all I go for that's all I can think about\nT:\tmmm yeah I think it's really got that reward circuit in our brain down yeah yeah yeah yeah well is that something you'd like to cut back on\nC:\tOh a little\nT:\till so you'd like to be I love I got ice cream okay\nC:\tand let the point one I I don't forgot to say no never but I'm at the point where saying just don't need it I mean I could go for two but buying it out of the grocery store it's not working for me it's not allergies\nT:\tonly you're thinking not getting into the house\nC:\tyeah I keep it out of the house\nT:\thaha not come thank you a very good idea you are not shutting down will not let this happen I've already been with apple support it looks like YouTube needs a talking okay so ice cream is the goal\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay\nC:\ta leather go\nT:\tall right and in what would you say your your specific goal would be about ice cream that you really like to not have it in the house is that your main thing or\nC:\tnot having a now yeah that's that would be huge to having it cuz that's really where I'm breaking down is when I bite it and I gallon put it in two days you know\nT:\tyeah and that's so easy to do because it's not filling you know and you know we it turns to liquid in our stomach to everybody\nC:\tI mean it for breakfast\nT:\toh sure\nC:\tyeah\nT:\toh absolutely yeah that is one of the strategies I used once I just have a little in the morning and burn it off you know and all that's doing is lighting that fire in there I don't know something ya\nC:\tgot extreme hung up\nT:\tokay so the goal is just not have it at home\nC:\tokay yeah\nT:\tand how confident would you say you feel and again we're going to go back to as if you roll the clock 0 to 10 0 and 0 is you don't feel at all confident and 10 as you feel completely confident that you will be able to make this change if not having ice cream in the house and maybe we'll say Joanna for the time of you know an estimate of help for how long\nC:\tum\nT:\tweek two weeks\nC:\tlet's say two weeks\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso I'm going to have to find a healthy choice to get when i get those urge for that ice cream and then instead of walking in the store going to present food i'll keep the ODI go the other way and pick up fruit\nT:\tyeah it's funny when I think it's hannaford here in Calais the ice cream is over that way and the produce is over the head okay no it's like making a right turn instead of a left turn\nC:\tit's an interesting it sorry\nT:\tyeah it's the right and it's the right way you go yeah young you could have a cup am i right yeah all right thank you let's take the right turn out of the right right whatever nothing yet\nC:\tum so uh do we could be the challenge to we could be a good challenge\nT:\tso why would you put your confidence 0 to 10 and i'll let you make a mark to feel like\nC:\ti'm gonna say a seven right now\nT:\tum\nC:\tjust just because i can think of go right lots of cash registers between there and the foot the frozen food so if i get out before that\nT:\tum\nC:\tthat would be good it would certainly if i die that was thinking about the pain and my loss of mobility can write that I hereby your ruler I can remember that if I go all the way the other way to the frozen food so I go left I'm going to have pain if I go right come on much better chance of feeling better\nT:\tokay\nC:\tand\nT:\tand that brings up an idea I might be able to help you with maybe next time we meet if you like\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand that is of course we'll check in and see how it was not going fun also there's a process called thought mapping that's a method where you walk yourself through step by step going into the store how you're feeling anything to do with feelings about ice cream and and you can rehearse in your own mind\nC:\tuh-huh\nT:\tmaking the right turn instead of the wrong turn\nC:\tpeddling visualization like athletes do\nT:\tyes exactly and part of that yeah the way that they visualize they want to do that I left then I hi pole vault oh and they by picturing themselves doing it they actively Prix the performance improves\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tsame story here\nC:\tokay I understood that\nT:\tso we might we might plan that or it sounds like you kind of got a sense of how it works\nC:\tyeah I'm familiar with visualization I'm good at all which is I think pretty close to mind mapping so so you think about it down the painful way and then you replace that with thinking about it with a healthier\nT:\tyeah yeah it's a little bit of a but if if you already it sounds like you've already got a sense of how visualization works on and you might be able to just decide say I mean what it makes sense to you even as you're young either in the car about to get it go into the store that you're visualizing yourself or maybe at home before you go out you know whatever makes sense to you you could even experiment a bit on your own\nC:\toh yeah\nT:\tit works yeah yeah and visualizing now so I'm ever visualizing the fruit you know and having kinds that you really like you know and if you like variety you know one make it as enjoyable as possible but you are so wise to come up with that idea of substituting something you know putting having something else in place of because when we just take something away something else in the brain goes 0 or you're taking my you know it didn't\nC:\tya\nT:\tI'm going to have this instead this is much better\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand I should check the time for measures when we are I get 15 minutes\nC:\tI hackathon and over here\nT:\twe are on not seeing oh yes we are i think we can stop ok so i will look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks and\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twish you well\nC:\tthank you very much do we have to attract a great plan going here ok\n",

  "T:\tit's good to see you\nC:\tthanks it's good to be here\nT:\tI want to talk to you about some of your symptoms try to figure out what's going on with you\nC:\tokay\nT:\twe're talking earlier and you mentioned you had some some thinking that was thoughts that were bothering it okay tell me about those\nC:\tum well it's really weird and uncomfortable and well but I feel like I'm being monitored by the CIA and I really I don't like it and they're using my cell phone\nT:\tokay the CIA's using your cell phone to track your activities\nC:\tyeah to track my activities and to find out what's going on in my brain\nT:\tokay do you know why they be doing this\nC:\twell I'm I'm really not sure I think that well I'm say you're thinking about replacing me with a robot\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso you know my thoughts are pretty important and you know I'm not you know\nT:\tya know it sounds very frustrating\nC:\tidiots\nT:\tso I asked you and you ever ever see or hear things other people can't see or hear\nC:\tI don't think summed up\nT:\tokay so like an idea how this impacts your daily life can you tell me how this these recurring thoughts about the CIA even affect how you function from a daily basis\nC:\twell yesterday I was getting the kids ready for school and trying to get ready for work and I mean normally that goes pretty smoothly but I didn't want to pick up my cell phone and put it in my bag because I was really afraid I didn't know if it's just when I put it up to my ear or when I touch it that they can affect\nT:\tyou know not sure how they're really tracking\nC:\texactly and it was really hard for me to get the kids ready for school to get ready for work and I was late for work and and my boss was for the mad but\nT:\tokay so it does seem like it's interfering with your functioning a little bit yeah I scan the way of your daily routine\nC:\tyeah definitely\nT:\tit is\nC:\tdefinitely\nT:\tokay uh can you tell me how many times that this has happened to you we have these recurring thoughts about the CIA do you remember any other times\nC:\tin the past it has no this is definitely they just started doing this they'd never done this to me before\nT:\tokay how long ago did they start\nC:\tum I'd say about a month okay spent it's been over a month you've had it\nT:\tum yeah\nC:\tyeah all right this information has been useful thank you\nT:\tit's good to see him\nC:\tthanks thanks good to be here\nT:\tI want to talk a little about the symptoms you've been having lately\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou had mentioned earlier that something happened and you had some symptoms that bothered you can you explain that to me\nC:\twell yeah I was it's really embarrassing but I I was hearing my aunt talking to me and it was like she was talking through a loudspeaker and you know it\nT:\twhen you let me clarify and say you were hearing your hand talk to you was she there\nC:\tno stead\nT:\twell she's passed away\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tso but you could still hear her voice\nC:\toh yeah I heard her voice yeah and but she's dead so I could have heard her voice and it sounded like it was coming through a loudspeaker and she was definitely talking to me and it was really freaking me out\nT:\tyou know what she was saying I didn't make out words\nC:\tum yeah she was she was talking to me about you know keeping my room leader\nT:\tis that something she's to say when she was around which was a lot\nC:\tno\nT:\tno\nC:\tno\nT:\tyou have any idea what my brought these symptoms on\nC:\twell maybe it was the attack\nT:\tshe talked about that\nC:\tyeah I was coming out of the library and was downtown and I was headed to my car and it was late and the sky he just came out of nowhere and you know he's really rough language and he grabbed my pocketbook and then he took off and it was really it was really really upsetting there was a policeman nearby and you know they found the guy you know he's he's wouldn't jail but I got my pocketbook back and but it was horrible\nT:\tI'm so scary\nC:\tit was really bad yeah yeah maybe that was what I mean it was it was after that that I started hearing my name\nT:\tyour hands voice\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tabout how long have you been hearing her voice\nC:\tit well it was it was it was only two days but but it was real\nT:\tit was frightening Gordon\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tcan tell me what happened after those two days that when the voices stopped\nC:\twell I mean my husband was really supportive of me through it all and you know my my mom my kids everybody I felt like people were there for me and you know I guess I kind of knew that you know I was taken care of and and then they just sort of stopped and and things went back to normal again\nT:\tokay so since you've had since the voices stopped you really haven't had any problems\nC:\tI guess not no\nT:\tdo you remember any occasion before this episode with the guy attacking you and then you have the voices with something like this that before\nC:\tno definitely not\nT:\tthe only time\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand this has been very useful I appreciate you\nT:\tit's good to see you Diane\nC:\tthank you good to see you\nT:\tI ask you some questions out what's going on and see how you're feeling you tell me what's going on\nC:\tyou don't know already\nT:\tI don't know\nC:\tthey didn't tell you\nT:\tI got a little bit of an idea but I really don't know I need to hear from you\nC:\tum well it's still they the CIA 15 times\nT:\t15 times\nC:\t18 times flowers the CIA is absolutely following me in French sometimes Latin\nT:\twhat what has happened that makes you believe the CIA's is following\nC:\tdid you say that fifteen times it's their shadows I know they're there they might be there now\nT:\tnow when you say bye to him or your firm\nC:\tsake Bob the flowers and 15 times do they talk to you the CIA\nT:\tyou don't talk to mate\nC:\toh okay\nT:\tdid you talk to you though\nC:\tthey don't talk to me but they don't know I hear them too\nT:\tdo you think they're here right now\nC:\tclothes should not be left on the floor but the refrigerator has five bags the flowers no\nT:\tso you're not sure if they're here now\nC:\tthe CIA is here\nT:\tthey are here that's because you can hear the or you can you said earlier you could hear what they're talking about it here's something\nC:\tI'm not very comfortable discussing this if I see the shadows I know they're there they don't know that I can hear them and\nT:\tyou can hear them and you can see that the shadows that we've on the ground\nC:\twhy wouldn't you want to know the shadows around the wall\nT:\tyou see the shadows\nC:\tI hear their voices in French\nT:\tso an let me ask you it sounds like this is disturbing you how long has it been going on\nC:\tthis time\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tthis time 90 years and why not forever this time I've known they're here for I think well a very long time\nT:\tas long as you can remember is there ever\nC:\talways yes\nT:\tis every time you didn't have this happening we see I wasn't chasing you\nC:\tmaybe they're quieter at times but they've always been there\nT:\thow about when you were younger was there time when you didn't feel like they were bothering in\nC:\tcereal boxes convulsive water I don't feel comfortable discussing this they were always in with me\nT:\tthey've always with you this information has been useful thank you\n",
  "T:\they Marissa it's nice to see you again I'm really glad you came back I am this is about our second session and last session we kind of talked about you and some just a little bit about you and we left off about you know where what you and your friends do on the weekends and you had mentioned the alcohol so this session I thought we could talk about what you do on the weekends with your friends and you know how much alcohol you guys are using and kind of stuff like that does that sound all right yeah good so let's get started so can you tell me a little bit about what you guys do on the weekends\nC:\twe have parties the days we drink I mostly parties being thrown like dance around a big crowd other weekends just a few of us or hanging out watching movies\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso it kind of depends on the activity if alcohols involved or not yeah\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about the difference a pleasure you get from the weekends you're drinking alcohol to the weekends you know I\nC:\tI mean a party is more energetic but obviously tiring after but in the moment like it's fun and you're dancing around you're drinking and having fun but then over just watching movies it's kind of more calm relaxing but sometimes kind of boring\nT:\tokay so there's kind of some pros and cons to both sides of drinking and not drinking\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so what are some of these things that you do like about alcohol\nC:\tfollow me drink we usually have more fun a little bit more loosen to relax but don't wanna drink too much obviously that can be bad\nT:\tmm-hmm so it sounds like when you're drinking a little too much it's kind of turns into a bad time but you just drink you're right about the right amount or just a little bit you're have fun with your friends and you know not not getting into too bad of situations that's not about right so what are some things that you don't like about drinking\nC:\ta lot of time it just makes people like stupid make dumb decisions but we try to be as safe as possible like staying at friend's house so you don't drink and drive or are having like weird strangers come over and put things in your drink or won't have with that\nT:\tokay so you're saying thank by staying at some friends houses and you know kind of watching out on trust when you're drinking alcohol and but you're you know something so I'm like they're still kind of happening and even with after kind of planning us out\nC:\tyeah sometimes\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about that\nC:\tum I just felt like when when I'm me or one of my friends drinks too much and like we end up puking it's just not fun when that happens\nT:\tyeah peaking definitely outside I can just can't imagine the feeling so I'm sorry you had to experience that\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tcan you tell me how often you have thrown up from drinking alcohol\nC:\tjust once for me it was the first time I'd ever drink so I just drink way too much I didn't know what I was doing mixed in all kinds of alcohol I'm just drinking what everybody what anybody would give me and that didn't end up - well Eisley so after that I haven't really I still have friends that throw up and drink way too much and I have to take care of that take care of them so that's sometimes kind of a downer\nT:\tokay so on one side some of the things with alcohol or you know it creates you to be a little relaxed and carefree and have fun to dance but on the other hand you know there's a little bit more cleaning involved to be safe about it and sometimes you know you drink a little bit too much and that can cause it down on your night for you or you know how to take care of a friend\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so earlier you had mentioned that a couple times that you had had to some decisions with limiting your alcohol and you know that make it as safe as possible why don't you think that you uh did that\nC:\twell I have an aunt that's an alcoholic so I see like the drinking issues and I know how bad drinking can be like I've seen movies and things and I just want to be safe and being a saint setting where I can let loose like a parents house like a friend who's cooler so I mean I'm gonna have fun but I want to limit the dangers I just want to make sure that when we're drinking and that we respect like so ever somewhere in\nT:\tyeah but something you kind of get a good head on your shoulders and respect must be a big value to you\nC:\tyeah I think it's important to respect others and then get that respect in return\nT:\tokay so do you think that drinking kind of fits in with that value or how does that fit in with your value of respect\nC:\twell I think drinking is kind of disrespectful to your own body because you're putting things that shouldn't be in there and I respect myself by limiting my drinking and like staying at someone's house to be safe and just limiting my actions of who I hang out with when I drink\nT:\tokay so you're kind of looking at balancing you know how much you can drink with some positive benefits without crossing over to those negative sides so what have you come up with at this point do you sort of stick to a limit\nC:\tI mean I make my own drinks and I like exactly how much is in it what's in it so I can control it like I'll make one drink to make it last as long as possible so if somebody comes up and it's like here I have this drink I'm are I'm like I'm gonna die already have this and I'm still able to let loose\nT:\tokay so you pretty much it feels like it works for you and you kind of have it spelled out where you know it goes smooth so you're sort of balancing that and sometimes do you ever exceed that limit\nC:\tfor the most part it works really well I still have come people people come up to me like at a party and pressure me and I'm just like no I'm good I've already had some that have my drink but sometimes people be like take a shot and then like everybody gathers in the kitchen and takes one together so sometimes like that I'll drink too much\nT:\tokay so a portion of the time it's working in the other portion the time it's kind of like you just go with the flow\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tokay so kind of thinking on those lines how important is it is it to you to make some changes or adjustments to your drinking when you're looking at your values or maybe your future plans\nC:\tin terms of like respecting my values and body I'd like to drink less cuz it's nice to let loose enough fun but I don't want to you know like damage my body I have my friends on boards I can work with that like the peer pressure to drink more like the shots so for right now I don't really know if I can quit cuz all my friends are drinking\nT:\tdon't do your friends peer pressure you\nC:\tsometimes but I mean I think they'd support me if I'm trying to quit\nT:\tokay so you may find it hard to stop drinking completely because they're drinking around to you but if you might find it easier if you just lessons about of drinking but your friends wouldn't support you either way it sounds like\nC:\tyeah and hopefully maybe they'd even slow down on their drinkin\nT:\tyeah won't be no good for all of you guys to kind of do it together so you kind of have a goal to set back them out of you drink how important is it to you maybe on a scale of one to ten one being the not that pour in at all so you tend being the most important thing to you right now\nC:\tI'd say like a six or seven like I'd like to work on it if I can get around to that I don't I don't\nT:\tokay so why would you pick a six or seven may be compared to a four\nC:\tI mean I think it's important and like I know it can affect my body and wanting to be a doctor in it health is going to be really important to me and it can affect my social life and schoolwork\nT:\tokay so you're just kind of making those changes when you feel like it's gonna fit ninto your life\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tokay so looking ahead you kind of thik that drinking wouldn't really help you with those goals\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so how confident are you that you can make these changes on a scale of one to ten one being not confident at all and ten being the most confident you've ever felt\nC:\tyeah I mean if I had decided that I was going to do it for sure that they attend\nT:\tWow so 10 is pretty pretty big so why do you think you picked a 10\nC:\tbecause I mean I know I can do it it's just making the decision to do it\nT:\tokay so maybe you had mentioned you'd like to cut down but you have to have the right timing and it's got to be you know 100 percent you're doing it\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so what else do you think you could do with that how could you you know cut down on your drinking\nC:\tI was thinking about talking to my friends no I don't want to sound dorky but like let's stay in tonight and not go out or just be like I'm not gonna drink tonight but and then I want them to be like okay with that like okay with me not drinking\nT:\tokay so sort of you know playing activities that might not include alcohol as much and kind of getting your friends on board with being okay with doing this alcohol or those activities without alcohol okay so do you feel like this is a goal that you could maybe set and be willing to work on\nC:\tI think so\nT:\tokay well would it be okay if we met for the next couple weeks and kind of worked on this goal together\nC:\tyeah I think WR\nT:\tokay well your commitment to changing you know kind of this behavior and you know making a commitment to chat really shows that you're going on to the next step and you know making a change for you know maybe the better for your life if that's what you know it's for you so does that sound like that's kind of right\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tokay so I'm just gonna do a little summary it sounds like you're kind of studying big goals for yourself like becoming a doctor and graduating high school and go to college and I'm really looking forward to you know see how you do and I think you'll do great and looking forward to school and it sounds like you have a pretty good social life and you know you're pretty active in sports from what I heard earlier for my last session and that all these benefits can help you you know maybe from cutting back on alcohol with maybe you know bettering your school performance and really helping your health and you know possibly you know helping you find belonging with your friends without having to have alcohol and also it's really exciting to have a really good plan in place as long as you're willing you know I would really like to be real working with you\nC:\tokay\nT:\tall right well I'll see you next week\nT:\tall right well Dana I want to welcome you back into my office I appreciate your willingness to come back this week it was really a pleasure to get to know you a little bit last week and I really do appreciate your willingness to be so vulnerable with me I know it's not easy to just spill your guts with a stranger so I really appreciate that is there anything that I can do right now to make you a little more comfortable okay well as you know you're more than welcome to use the restroom if you need to while we're having our conversation so if you do it's just right around the corner I also want to briefly remind you of our confidentiality rules and I told you last week that I always just like to reiterate that everything you say in this room will be completely confidential the only reason that I would have to break that as of course if you were to tell me that you have an intent to harm yourself or anyone else so last week you talked a little bit about what brought you into the office excuse me and why you're seeking treatment with your use of marijuana um I heard you say that you're having increased difficulties with your asthma as a result of your smoking yes is that about right\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay well you're a primary care physician thought it might be helpful for you to come talk to me a little bit about your asthma and your use of marijuana because he's I think he's worried about your use of marijuana with your condition which you agreed to come speak with me so am I on track here so far\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay all right well perfect well since we discussed a little bit about your history last week I want to begin this week by discussing the cravings that you experience and maybe what we can do to help cope with some of those cravings in other words maybe develop some alternatives to smoking do have these cravings how does that sound\nC:\tsounds all right I mean I'm not really sure how I'm gonna be able to do that but like what exactly do you mean\nT:\tokay well let's just start a little bit by talking about your cravings the cravings themselves when you wake up in the morning you start your day when does a typical cravings start for you\nC:\tabout the second or you that wake up\nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about what that's like for you\nC:\tso it kind of makes me feel real calm and relaxed when I smoke and it kind of keeps me relaxed throughout the day so I continue to smoke you know to keep that high and you know just helps me not stressed about work\nT:\tokay so the types of planning that we typically do to help these cravings include components of reminding ourselves of maybe the negative consequences that come along with these behaviors so another component would be to find alternatives to this solution so when you wake up and think who I know I'll be more calm throughout the day I'll be more relaxed at work maybe could we try to remind ourselves of the negative consequence that we discussed last week like I'll be more likely to be late to work if I sweat this morning these are just some examples of some ways that we can help remind ourselves throughout the day to maybe combat these cravings but I know maybe that's easier said than done like I'll wake up and just tell myself that it won't be beneficial you know sometimes that's easier said than done so another thing that we can do is find very specific alternatives to the smoking so we could look at other activities that may provide this relaxation and calming feeling that you're describing would you have any ideas about I know we talked a little bit last week and you're going to think about maybe some alternatives were you able to come up with thing\nC:\tI just don't really know how alternatives are gonna help me avoid smoking\nT:\tokay so I hear you say that you don't see how discussing alternatives will help you stop smoking\nC:\texactly I mean I'm enjoy doing things but not as much as I'd enjoy when I smoke\nT:\tokay so nothing else that you can do will relax you as much as marijuana does\nC:\tyeah I mean there may be some things but there's nothing like that right now that I do that relaxes me as much as marijuana does\nT:\tokay so what would it be like for you if we were maybe to just explore some new activities or new techniques that could provide you some relaxation\nC:\tI'm really not good to change or trying new things\nT:\tokay well that's understandable change is hard and it's hard for a lot of people if trying something completely new would be too difficult maybe we could find something that you've tried in the past or liked in the past I don't want us to choose anything that would be uncomfortable for you so let me ask maybe what kinds of activities have you done before that brought you the sense of being relaxed and peace\nC:\twell I used to be a big runner but I stopped running about maybe eight years that'll go\nT:\tokay I know you mentioned last week that you started smoking about a year ago would it be fair to assume that you stopped running around the same time you started some anything\nC:\tyeah I'd be fair to assume that I guess\nT:\tokay so you said that you were a big runner what role did running play in your life\nC:\tI just kind of helped me wind down after a long day of work I'd go on a run after work and it kind of helped me to decompress\nT:\tokay so it sounds like running really helped to bring a sense of relaxation to you\nC:\tyeah I really did it kind of calmed my nerves and made me feel better about you know just about everything\nT:\tokay so what let me ask you what would it be like if we were to bring running into your life again\nC:\tI guess I haven't really considered that option\nT:\tokay well I want you to take a second and imagine what it would be like for you to running what would that look like if you were to imagine that\nC:\thonestly I'd probably be much more relaxed after work and I wouldn't be able to smoke right after you know something worked like or something I've done you know that has stressed me out\nT:\tokay so Dana I'm hearing you say that running brings you a really great sense of calmness would this be something we could set as maybe homework for next time like in between our next session now in our next session for you to try running again to replace the calmness smoking brings to you\nC:\tI think so it might take me a hot second to get started up on you know running a long distance\nT:\tokay well I appreciate your willingness to consider it I know you said it's a bit awhile and it takes some courage it really does to get back into something that you haven't done and as maybe has gotten a little unfamiliar so I appreciate that\nC:\tyeah I mean it'll be hard at first but my doctor has actually been telling me that running would really help me with my asthma you know\nT:\tokay well perfect that sounds like that's really would be a good fit to improve your asthma which is what brought you here in the first place and then maybe help you cut down on the smoking does it sound about right to you\nC:\tyeah I mean that sounds about right it's kind of it's on all pages for everything\nT:\tokay awesome I'm wondering if you'd be willing to do something else for me so we're gonna try the running and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to journal maybe after a run so say if you chose to run three days after work next week just jot down a couple things like what it was like to start running again or if you were to think about any of the cravings or just your treatment in general just what it was like to go running again for you Kasana you mentioned last session that you really used to love journaling and reading and so that's why I bring it up because I know you used to enjoy your journaling\nC:\tokay yeah I mean I actually probably like that because I did journal a lot about you know just random things and that was just about and stuff so it'd be nice to maybe get back into that\nT:\tokay and journaling helped you\nC:\tit it kind of did it was I mean it helped me like sort out my stresses\nT:\tokay okay well it sounds like we have a solid plan in place how are you feeling right  now about our plan and today\nC:\tI feel really good about it I know I've been wanting to get back into both running and you know journaling and this will help me kind of with my stress but you know and it's kind of a big opportunity to start making changes and you know I want to get better because my Aspen it's really kicking my butt and I want to start exercising more maybe stop smoking\nT:\tokay well I'm hearing you say that you're excited to try this is that what's out there\nC:\tyeah kind of excited kind of kind of weird okay\nT:\twell I want to thank you for being so open and honest with me again today just like last week you know it's hard to just open up to a stranger so I thank you again for that and I'm really excited to try this new plan a few Dana I'm excited to grow with you and help you in any way that I can in this journey so next week we'll review your journal and discuss kind of how running was for you and hopefully maybe help them with these cravings and divulge a little bit into that a little bit more how is that sounding\nC:\tsounds pretty often\nT:\tokay well how does next week about the same time same place\nC:\tyeah sounds good\nT:\tokay well great thanks for coming in\n",
  "T:\tyou it's good to see it\nC:\tyeah thank you\nT:\tI understand you've been having some difficulties because of the trauma I want to ask you some questions about that that's okay so can you tell me a little bit about the traumatic event\nC:\twell my my three-year-old is a day care sure he takes a week mow well I meant work and that was it was the day care where there was the fire remember and she was there that day and it was you know on the news I heard about it I didn't know if she was okay for quite some time if any of the kids were okay it was it was really disturbing and I've not been quite the same since\nT:\tthat's your daughter your daughters at this daycare when the fire but she but she's okay\nC:\tshe is she's fine thank God\nT:\tof course that would be extremely stressful\nC:\toh I can't tell you yeah\nT:\tThanks so let me continue to ask some different questions that's okay I appreciate you being able to recall the events of the trauma that's very difficult to speak about that so let me ask you about some symptoms nice let me know if you've been having them or not\nC:\tokay\nT:\thave you found that you're having any type of intrusive or distressing memories about this event\nC:\tyeah last night when I was cooking dinner I went to the refrigerator and the house can give up the meat and I saw the orange juice and I remembered I packed orange juice for my daughter that day and it just saw the orange juice and I flashed back to just when I heard what was going on I didn't know if she was okay and it was like it was actually happening you know standing there at the refrigerator it was like I was back that day waiting to hear\nT:\tit blow at all oh my god\nC:\tyeah\nT:\thave you ever hang trouble with distressing dreams since this event is happening\nC:\tno nothing not really not really any dreams\nT:\tokay and have there ever been any other situations that have reminded you of this traumatic event like cues from the from the environment or anything for surroundings\nC:\toh yeah actually I was you know walking by another daycare wasn't even my daughter's daycare and I saw the kids playing outside and\nT:\tthat triggered some some emotions for you\nC:\toh my god was terrified you know terrorist yeah yeah and it was like I stopped I was terrified and I stopped almost like I ate it so prefer myself do you know what I mean like it was like I floated up and could almost see myself and see those cannons and it was really weird\nT:\tsee I'm gonna ask you a few more questions I appreciate your help so far in this I know this is tough going through all these all these questions and kind of reliving some of this I want to ask you about a couple of items that may be occurring and just let me know if they resonate with you feel like this has been going on since the strong okay do you find yourself working to avoid distressing memories thoughts or feelings that you associate with this traumatic event\nC:\twell yeah I don't like thinking about it I don't like the game but if it starts to come in in my mind I just want to do something else I it's it's not pleasant\nT:\tyou actively tried to avoid thinking and feeling a certain life\nC:\tis that wrong yeah I do because when you know I'll start thinking about that morning and like oh god I just don't want to get into those feelings I don't you know so yeah\nT:\tokay how about do you find yourself trying to avoid things that might remind you of that traumatic event\nC:\toh like I have to go by the fire station on my way to work and yeah I if I if I Drive by it I think about it and then you know at least five or ten minutes of my day is like you know and so I don't want to start my day thinking about that so I actually have to go like it's like six miles out of my way but I go the other direction I don't I don't want to drive by the fire\nT:\tit breaks back is this memories for you\nC:\tyeah I know that's weird but\nT:\tno it's actually fairly common but I appreciate you sharing this with I know it's difficult say I'm going to continue on some some other questions appreciate your patience all these these questions and you've been forthcoming with your answers I want to ask you some questions about a possible mood disturbances because this event do you ever find yourself unable to remember having trouble would remember important aspects of the trauma how about negative beliefs or expectations about yourself or others maybe kind of changing your attitude and the way you're relating to the world or yourself if you find yourself having distorted thinking that we kind of blame kind of blame yourself even though you clearly weren't responsible for it\nC:\tlike I'm thinking what kind of mom puts her daughter in daycare my mom always told me not to I thought I have to be this independent woman and work and that what you mean\nT:\tyeah okay I have that\nC:\thow about negative emotional states like anger guilt shame anything like that sadness have you noticed negative emotional states since you've been since you experienced and strong yeah yeah you tell me which one's guilt\nT:\tguilt definitely sadness joke says yeah any think some anger it myself you know anger you know the the day care I mean where they have to code you know I definitely get angry at them for letting that happen my daughter there sometimes but\nC:\tanyone that yeah have you noticed that you don't have as much interest in participating in activities that you once did participate in\nT:\tactually you know I haven't played tennis at all this has happened I you know I used to play twice a week and I just sort of feel like I don't want to yeah tennis I haven't got a book group I've been tired you know yeah\nC:\thow about feeling detached or strange from other people has that been happening -\nT:\tno no I mean I've been like talking to my book friends on Facebook you know my texts ya know\nC:\tit's all normal activities\nT:\tyeah good\nC:\thow about an inability to experience positive emotions maybe like used to before any struggle there\nT:\tthat kinda rings Bell does it yeah what would positive emotions do you feel like you're not being able to experience this\nC:\twell well definitely I guess my sense of joy is just diminished you know my delight and you know I I saw a red bird outside the Cardinal outside the window the other day and I noticed that it was just sort of fair you know normally I kind of light up\nT:\tyou had a much stronger positive reaction\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tall right I have some more questions for you these have to do with a little little bit different topic but just same you know similarly if any of these kind of resonate with you if you've gone through them just something that\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand this is I can't as with these other items this is symptoms I'm talking about it happen after or became worse after the trauma okay that's occurred or became hoarse after the trauma after it happened so have you found that your have angry outburst or you're more irritable more likely to express physical or verbal aggression how about any reckless or self-destructive behavior has that been a problem have you found yourself more aware of your environment my potential dangers\nC:\tlike yeah yeah I'm just waiting like I actually you know I usually plug the curling iron in before or I go you know and do my stuff in via the bathroom in the morning and I've been feeling weird about it and you not come back in check it actually I only went earlier and I want him in the room so yeah and just sort of overall I've been feeling kind of just really aware of you know what could hurt me what could hurt her\nT:\teven more aware of your environment channel\nC:\toh definitely for threats looking for us\nT:\tyeah like this curling iron could start a fire you know even driving you know what\nC:\tso tell me about how you assess threats before the trauma he feels the same way or different\nT:\twell no I I guess I didn't really think about it as much before I mean that sounds kind of bad but now I'm thinking about it all the time you know even like somebody coming down the street like could he'd be dangerous should we move you know the other side of the street I said about you know definitely of things that could start a fire in the house and yeah I'm just really paranoid it seems a lot about you know our safety\nC:\tokay so let me ask you about I'm gonna talk a second about startled response which everyone has time time we get startled loud noises something we don't expect have you noticed that your startle response your vulnerability to be startled has changed at all since then\nT:\tit's that part of this because yeah the other day like my husband came up just to you know give me a hug and I like jumped I shouted you know what no what else happened we were watching something on TV and I was like he started laughing at me but it wasn't funny funny - no no yeah I know what you mean you know\nC:\tthat's changed have you noticed since the trauma any trouble concentrating how about a change in sleep like difficulty falling or staying asleep or wrestles and how long have the symptoms we talked about nevertheless you miss how long didn't bothering you\nT:\tit's it's about two months about two months ago yeah and\nC:\twe've been talking about a lot of the symptoms that you've been having over or because of this trauma or that we're worse than by this trauma and I'm like an idea of the level of distress you're experiencing in your social world occupational world other important areas to you did tell me about that\nT:\tit's it's pretty pervasive we were out to dinner with you know our best friends and it was their anniversary and it was so nice that they asked us to come with them but I just you know it wasn't that fun that was just really I just kept thinking about her and being there that fire and it really yeah I'm sorry yeah\nC:\tno it's\nT:\tI'm feeling it all the time and I'm feeling it really intensely\nC:\tso you know how does it work -\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso I with friends and no such missions work\nT:\twork yeah definitely\nC:\tso you feel like this these symptoms we talked about if you think they're getting in the way of your life\nT:\toh my god yeah you\nC:\tT\nT:\tso we have been asking questions this traumatic event and I appreciate your help in this can you tell me a little bit about this event\nC:\toh yeah there was a fire in this daycare and they're like 18 kids there it barely made it out alive I just keep thinking about it\nT:\twhere was the stake character relation to her unit thought\nC:\tit was in New York anyway I'm in Union no\nT:\tthat's my best man yeah\nC:\tdid you know anybody that was personally\nT:\tno I didn't but it's that I mean it's hard\nC:\tit's a terrible situation\nT:\tI can't stop thinking about it inside\nC:\thow'd you since you didn't know anybody how did you find out about this\nT:\tum well I saw it on TV oh um Tina I saw it on the news yeah\nC:\thas it been covered a lot in the news lately\nT:\tno but you know I was recording the show that I watch and it was on there and so I've just gone back and watched it you know again and again my wife I've heard it a couple other times on the news hey everybody yeah\nC:\tsee you kind of you kind of find yourself trying to watching it\nT:\tyeah yeah oh it's so can you imagine\nC:\tit's hard to process candles and let me ask you what do you do for a living\nT:\tum I'm a baker\nC:\thow about in previous jobs have you've done anything different than baking careers\nT:\tno no that's in 13 that's what I wanted to do\nC:\tall the way since 13\nT:\tyeah that's the only thing I've ever done okay\nC:\tso yeah and I appreciate you talk about the trauma but a few more questions for you as I move through this okay I'm gonna list some different symptoms Oh monie let me know how you feel about that that's connects with you kind of symptoms you know if you experience them if they resonate with you since this such traumatic event have you had any distressing memories about this\nT:\tnot really\nC:\tokay the dreams may change in your dreams and them distressing to ever feel like you're reliving the moment when the trauma occurred had other similar events brought out a strong reaction from you like other other stories of fires is that because that may have you had any cause of effect and a sense of fear or anxiety or terror say I'm gonna keep moving forward through some of these the questions I have to ask you in regard to this event do you find yourself avoiding making efforts to avoid memories thoughts or feelings so you associated with this event\nT:\tI have a lot of thoughts about it a lot of memories about it I think I've just kind of got to work through them you know we had this really sad but I can't let it roll my life you said it\nC:\tyou're more confronting them than avoiding them it sounds like\nT:\tI guess uh yeah\nC:\tokay how about right making any effort to avoid things that might remind you of the event like people places situations activities anything like that\nT:\tnot really I Drive by the fire I have fire house on my way to work most mornings like I see it and I think about that day but you know Who am I gonna do try six months out of my way you know I don't think so yeah\nC:\tyou're not really you know they try to avoid any reminders at this time so I have some other questions now about emotional state I appreciate your patience and with these questions they're kind of mostly related to your mood and much I to understand how your voice but since the dramatic event do you find yourself any trouble remembering anything about the traumatic event have you noticed since the event that you have any kind of exaggerated negative beliefs about the world or yourself other people okay how about distorted thinking surrounding what would caused the event\nT:\tno it was pretty straightforward\nC:\tyou understand what caused it\nT:\toh yeah\nC:\thave you found that you've had any negative emotional states like sadness or guilt or shame\nT:\tor the normal\nC:\thave you noticed that your interest in participating and other activities has been decreased or that you feel more detached or estranged from other people how about you do you feel like you have the ability to experience positive emotions like happiness enjoy\nT:\twell it's funny you say that you no\nC:\tno\nT:\tno I don't really feel you know a lot of joy or happiness you know I thought about that when I was like 16 17 8 I don't really feel joy like other people I don't think we never have\nC:\tthat's right sad sama I'm gonna continue to ask some questions here I appreciate your patience to this these questions have to do with feelings symptoms that started or got worse after the trouble\nT:\tokay\nC:\tthat's just let me know if any of these resonate with you or you feel like kind of match how you're feeling have you noticed any irritable behavior or angry out outburst\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou tell me about them\nT:\toh my god I jumped all over Joe this morning I mean he yeah he I mean continually puts his talent like right on the floor by the hammocks that I don't know I'm the servant or something just really I had enough and I used some foul language as I showed him myself putting the talent in a hamper but you know and last night I had dinner you know ready and he didn't come home for like I don't know he's like an hour and a half late no call no texts nothing perfectly good steaks and potatoes went to waste and said I let him know that I was not pleased\nC:\t20 games European aggravated\nT:\tyeah definitely\nC:\thave you noticed any reckless or self-destructive behavior since the trauma how about being more aware of your surroundings being more clued into danger I want to talk for a second about star response that's when like there's a loud noise or something happens that they don't expect and we will be cut jump yeah have you noticed that response has changed for you at all since the trauma any difficulty concentrating any trouble always sleep and these symptoms have been talking about in the last few minutes how long have they been coming on for you\nT:\tall week\nC:\tall week\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso yeah\nT:\twe've talked about a lot of different symptoms that you have due to this traumatic event or maybe they became worse because of what's happened so I'm like an idea of how much distress this has caused you in terms of social occupation or other important areas of your functioning can you describe that to me\nC:\tit's sad but you know she's safe she was safe that's the bottom line right so I mean I was I was sad about it that sound you know life goes on like this boy\nT:\thave you noticed it interfering in any way with your work or your relationship with your husband or children right not that\nC:\twhat the fact that she was in the fire\n",

struggling with wanting to lose the weight I would say for about a good six seven months now and all that I have seen so far is that I've been basically actually basically fluctuating between 199 and 206 sometimes even 208 the struggle today has been the frustration level of when I get on this okay I'm going to get on this quote-unquote diet and I'm going to lose the weight something amazing happens I actually end up painting I'm tired in the morning I'm stressed because we started this whole new business that we have here and I'm totally out of control I feel that I'm totally out of control when it comes to eating I think a lot of it has to do with not eating quote/unquote properly or systematically\nT:\tokay so for you I just threw a lot at me so I'd like to go back and recap some of the things that you were saying to make sure that I'm understanding everything clearly\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso in January 2010 you started a meal plan that was very strict and you were able to maintain it for a few years\nC:\tno few months\nT:\tfew months yes you think a few months and then you started to travel and you know kind of things kind of went a little bit astray from there\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyou went from this strict dieting all-or-nothing kind of plan do not really knowing how to make food for yourself or compose a meal for yourself because you were\nC:\tlet me was you know it's interesting you say that because that meal plan that I was on that diet plan yeah what's called a no decision\nT:\tyes it's a\nC:\tno decision diet which means you don't have to make any decisions about anything this is the prescription and you live with that prescription you'd be alright anyone else I kind of denied it\nT:\tso you almost kind of missed out on the education portion of how to eat when you're on your own\nC:\tyes\nT:\twhich is what in the long term we want to achieve is for you to be able to make healthy food choices when someone isn't there to tell you what to do you're able to critically think for yourself and regardless the nutrition\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso some other things that you mentioned was that you're just feeling frustrated and kind of out of control in regards to your weight-loss initiatives which I can which is very it seems very frustrating if you want to be losing weight and you're not not seeing it and then you said that you were tend to be eating more so those are all very frustrating things and not and then you also said that during your day you're not really eating consistently\nC:\tat all\nT:\tyou're kind of all over the place and kind of looking for more of you know consistent meal plan day in which you're not you know starving and then overeating later\nC:\tI do the kind of like keeping it's like I wish I had one person walking behind me this fear you whatever that says okay mealtime here it is it was like preparing it here it is you know so that because I just eat such a stressful and such a work living environment\nT:\tlet's talk about where you get most of your meals from\nC:\tI would literally stop at the supermarket or I would stop at a 7-eleven or I would stop at a couple of times I didn't know a lot of times i stopped at Dunkin Donuts right that pick up the donuts or at the other daughter shop I would pick up because it's fast a lot of times I'm eating out and it's not you know the best thing in the world\nT:\tokay um so I'm hearing that you get most of your meals from outside of the home\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand not typically cooking meals and kind of go for those more convenience convenience meals that's easy yes so how would you feel about going over some tips for when you're dining out that if that's if you're very busy and like that's the option that you're doing right now I'm just making some little tweaks because cooking at home may not be an option for you at this moment\nC:\tthat's very true probably I would say yes\nT:\tso making little changes\nC:\tyes in regards to the restaurant is the way everything changes\nT:\tyes are some some tips that you can implement when you're at the restaurant\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso some of the things that I would like to talk about so when you're ordering food from a restaurant you want to stay away from words such as like fried or just like also deep fried and kind of go for those words like royal bake and steam\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso recently you told me that you went to a restaurant and I have the menu printed out here and I would give you a copy of that\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand and you told me that you ordered the New York strip steak\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand you had bread and butter for your meal\nC:\tyes I do\nT:\tso just looking at the options here we do have a fresh fish option at the top\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand it says it's simply grilled with olive oil or you could get it pan-seared baked or blackened with lemon shallot butter\nC:\tmm-hm\nT:\tso I would probably say maybe to stay away from the lemon shallot butter noise and maybe steer towards that simply grilled with olive oil or the maybe the baked or\nC:\ta boy in this use\nT:\tyou could do the pan serve but the other ones are better option\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso that's um -\nC:\tI would have enjoyed the tilapia for exam\nT:\tokay so\nC:\tthat's what I like to eat that they were Chilean sea bass I would have enjoyed that too\nT:\tso that's an opportunity that you would be\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou enjoy billing to go change\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso going for those terms and maybe doing like maybe a fish option every once in a while as opposed to doing a steak\nC:\tyes\nT:\tokay some other tips so when you're ordering if you want to order a salad instead of ordering the salad and getting kind of like a Caesar dressing or something like that they typically kind of put a lot of dressing on salads so maybe ordering it on the side is a better option because then you can be in control of how much you would like to add on to the salad\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand typically going for maybe like a balsamic dressing is good or you could do a balsamic and olive oil dressing\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\ttypically most restaurants will have that option\nC:\tyes and I like both stomach vinaigrette\nT:\tso also in regards to restaurants portion sizes are typically very large and you had mentioned earlier that you know sometimes you just don't know when to stop eating or you tip you think you're hungrier than you are you just eat a lot at once\nC:\tyes\nT:\twhen you give that example with the bread\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso a good tip is to kind of ask for a to-go box in the beginning when you get to the restaurant\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tafter your meal comes and just put half of the food in the box and you don't open the box can't get home it's kind of bang for your buck too right because then you can either other real later\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand you could if you do choose a healthy option you can take it to work the next day and you'll have a lunch option for you here at the office\nC:\tyes\nT:\tum also when it comes to salads you really don't so here they have the chopped spinach salad for example there's bacon egg radishes mushrooms and warm bacon dressing just because a menu item has all these things included does not mean that you have to get it with all those things in it\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso you can easily tell them oh can I have the chopped chicken it's chopped spinner salad without the bacon\nC:\tright I don't like bacon\nT:\tso that is something that you could ask for for that side because I mean spinach is great mushrooms are great radishes are great egg is great you can always take out egg whites I mean the egg yolk if you don't want the egg yolk or anything like that so a lot of restaurants I think analogies are accommodating because they want to have your certainty they want to have your business\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso they're gonna try their best to make the customer happy\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso for me personally I often ask for changes in my in my orders unless they specifically specified please do not make changes on to the order or we can't make a change for this order I typically change majority of my orders\nC:\thmm\nT:\tbecause the foods that you eat or the foods that are commercially made are not necessarily the healthiest\nC:\tyes\nT:\tthey're made to appease the palate\nC:\tright\nT:\tso they usually have lots of fat and you know sugar and sodium and those kinds of things added to it to appeal to a wider variety of individuals\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tI have a little handout here so we can talk about some like portion sizes\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso a fist would be considered like a cup of rice or pasta or fruits or vegetables it's about the size of your fist is one serving\nC:\tnow that's cooked rice oh\nT:\tyes good right the palm of your hand is about three ounces so that would be for fish meat or poultry that's about the size some people say like a deck of cards it's about 4 ounces\nC:\thmm\nT:\tit's around there and then if you're gonna have nuts of reasons a handful is about 1 ounce there's like a little handful so one thumb would be one ounce of hard cheese or peanut butter and you said\nC:\tWow I love cheese you know\nT:\tand then for your thumb is a a teaspoon of our thumb tip is a tea spoon of cooking oil or margarine or butter and sugar\nC:\tteaspoon\nT:\tas a teaspoon why don't you try and start setting some goals for you in regards to some food we do\nC:\tokay\nT:\tof what would work\nC:\tthat seem so you go one\nT:\tso what is what is one goal\nC:\tthat you want you would like to accomplish for what's the eating out that I want to accomplish for eating out\nT:\tyeah so would you um what a goal be that you want to choose grilled options\nC:\twell I see\nT:\twhat you mean okay are you willing to do that choose grilled options\nC:\tyou know it's sometimes that would be a goal\nT:\tso how do you feel about journaling\nC:\thate was difficult to do but it was very exciting\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tbecause it is making me it helps me actually meet that objective\nT:\tokay so that seems like something that we could\nC:\tyeah I usually get up with you already six o'clock in the morning\nT:\twould you have time to journal that\nC:\tyeah I can make the time for that\nT:\tokay so um how many of these a week would you say you could draw\nC:\tI can technically journal every day\nT:\tokay so why don't you give a range of times so why don't we say four to seven times a week in the mornings for we can say until our next session so we can go you can go back and recap how the journaling is going for you\nC:\twhat am i generally I'm gonna do it in the morning\nT:\tgenerally how you're feeling physically maybe the food reflect on the food choices that you had made the day before maybe set some you said you like setting little objectives maybe little mini goals for yourself for the day things like that\nC:\tthat is easy for me to choose actually\nT:\tokay that's great so why don't we just make sure we're doing that let's say seventy-five percent of the time you're eating out\nC:\tokay that is really very doable for me\nT:\tokay\nC:\tbecause I do it every lunchtime when I go that's exactly\nT:\twhat I do we try and good ideas living by kind of like an 8020 percent rule so eighty percent of the time you're making healthy choices twenty percent of the time you can kind of you know feel like you're not as restricted because it seemed like in the past being on a very strict diet doesn't work in the long run because that's not how life works\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand things are thrown at you and you have to be a little bit valuable to your different situation\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso those are some good goals now I would like to talk a little bit maybe up some physical activity\nC:\tyes so I would love to be accused might cost me too much money\nT:\tyes so I'm understand that you do want to become more physically active and you've had experience in the past being physically active what do you feel has prevented you from from being physically active is it time is it being tired\nC:\tit's actually both time being tired\nT:\tokay you know what kinds of physical activity do you enjoy doing if you were to do physical activity what do you like doing\nC:\tI would I'm looking\nT:\tbiking swimming activities\nC:\tI love swimming\nT:\tokay\nC:\tI would I don't mind actually gonna get a treadmill on the place I don't I do enjoy those things because they do we find me when I do it I don't just like I'm tired\nT:\tyou start that's difficult he's very different getting there\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\tokay so um okay so starting is difficult but just remember that any little changes you're making are are good even if it's going to the gym for just a little bit in 20 or 15 20 minutes or just walking outside of your house and you know after work or in the morning around the lunch break just going outside getting some fresh air how do you feel about maybe parking further\nC:\tI do that\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyou know it's interesting but I don't do it all the time\nT:\tso maybe we'd like to set a goal for that so what about well what what seems good for you how often do you want to do it every time\nC:\twhat\nT:\twould you like to park far\nC:\tactually get all the time for a while I did and then I stopped I'm gonna park like the closest I can\nT:\tso even that alone will give you a little bit more\nC:\tthat's physical activity\nT:\texercise so maybe parking I don't know an exact distance but parking further away if you're going to the grocery store if you're going in and out of places just walking more in general\nC:\tyes but I get the idea though\nT:\ttypically once you start something you kind of like and start seeing results\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso that's where your motivation\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\tso your motivation lies and seeing results\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\tokay so then something to remember is that results don't come overnight and that's hard\nC:\tyes\nT:\tto have to stick to something and constantly remembering that and maybe that's something you could write about in your journaling too I'm saying that results literally writing results don't happen overnight\nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\tbecause if you do stick to a plan over time you will see results yes we exciting for you\nC:\tyes\nT:\tI'm the greatest so maybe getting up in the morning and going on the treadmill how often would you be willing to do that sure we\nC:\tyou know\nT:\tit's realistic a week realistically\nC:\tI mean I would love to do is float accent\nT:\tfour times a week so for how long do you think you can even go on\nC:\tI always wanted to be on the treadmill for about 60 minutes\nT:\t60\nC:\tyeah it feels good when I'm on threatening for 60 minutes\nT:\tdo you think that would be realistic for your schedule and now that we're saying that we're gonna be journal\nC:\tyou start out you mean you know\nT:\tokay so why don't we start trying with 20 minutes\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso for 15 or 10 minutes or 50 Matt what works best for your schedule\nC:\twell\nT:\twhat is realistic\nC:\tI have to tell you that I have tried the 10 and 15 minutes and it doesn't do much at all it doesn't feel like I have done much you know I mean\nT:\tover time\nC:\tI guess it depends on how I'm using the treadmill\nT:\tmm-hmm and over time it will help but you also have to couple it with your with I don't is\nC:\tI put down 20 minutes\nT:\t20 minutes\nC:\tdoctor for 20 minutes or day for four days a week\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\texcuse me on the treadmill and I can start without doing the incline or anything just to get myself back into doing it\nT:\tokay\nC:\tgetting used to it\nT:\tyeah it's going through the motions so yeah well it becomes kind of second nature\nC:\tright right\nT:\tthey say it takes about like 27 or 30 somewhere around their days to develop a habit\nC:\tI really that's interesting point\nT:\tI'll have to get you the exact number later but yeah so for it to start feeling second nature so it seems like you are really you want to make you're you're preparing to make the changes right so\nC:\tyes\nT:\tyou know you know that you want to make the changes and you feel ready to make you feel ready to make these changes\nC:\tI actually do yes I mean I'm was really really happy when you approached me to have this this meeting I really was and that's why I was sharing with you the details\nT:\tmhm\nC:\tit's almost like going to confession and because because I don't feel good about where I am I really don't\nT:\tmaybe one last thing I can mention right now\nC:\tum\nT:\this water\nC:\tis why it's I like water and I it's easy for me to drink water is because my throat got used to actually taking in that much water it's not a five-piece to be a fight than to begin\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know\nT:\tthat's like me to drinking water for me is a struggle and I have to make myself do it but I know that I'll feel rejuvenated and I'll my body will function better and let my metabolic processes happen like they should and get my food and digestive system going so they're very I mean we're made up of mostly water so your thought you brought he needs that\nC:\tyes\nT:\tand just keeps you more alert when you're dehydrated do typically more sluggish and you're less more likely to make poor nutrition decisions\nC:\tyes yeah\nT:\tso just drinking water so why don't we you said you've done it in the past right how do you feel about drinking five bottles\nC:\tI honestly would not mind at all especially if I started exercising I think\nT:\tso you know it's really cool as they have apps now\nC:\tthough\nT:\tthat you can track how much water you're drinking I'll have to drop\nC:\tand you give them out to anyone that for you\nT:\tmmm-hmm yeah and you can track how much water you're drinking out of there and there's other web sites or apps like MyFitnessPal that you can track what you're eating and it will track all the calories and things like that for your day so why don't we go over um why don't we recap some of the goals so I just wanted me to say your understanding you know what we went through and some things that we talked about\nC:\tokay let me tell you what they are\nT:\tyes please\nC:\tokay so the first thing he said is how about if I did some journaling and he said to do it between four and seven times per week in the morning and then I should actually indicate also in my journaling how I feel also he said to reflect on the food choices that I made for the day the day before and that should be part of my journaling\nT:\tyes you should be noting some goals for the rest of the day so I want to drink five remember to drink five bottles of water\nC:\tand I last part of my journal\nT:\tthings like that just was kind of like reminders for yourself\nC:\tokay the second thing there were five things all together the second thing was we talked about restaurants because I eat a lot\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tand he said that I really should choose always put in my mind that I should be choosing Royal Baker steamed 70% of the time but if I go with the 8020 rule it would be good I can do 82% of the time I should be doing good choice since 20% of time it can't be bad choices that's okay because many minutes so that's basically what I remember you say\nT:\twell I also want to reiterate that it's you know there's no good food and bad food right there's no such thing as good food bad food that's when we we come to pick like portion sizes right\nC:\tOh\nT:\tso food is food\nC:\tyes\nT:\tbut we want to have more you know plant-based foods and we meats and low-fat dairy and whole grains and things like that\nC:\tum\nT:\tand fruits and things because of all the health benefits that they have\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand then we want to you know for sweets and other other treats and desserts we want to keep them as treats and desserts and by doing by keeping a portion the size small we can also you know continue our goal of weight loss\nC:\tokay\nT:\tbecause we don't want to you know deprive you and then all of a sudden oh I want to binge eat all this food\nC:\tright\nT:\tso and you know there's you know events and parties and things like that that you kind of need to be you know okay with you know living a little bit\nC:\tyes\nT:\tso that's it\nC:\tokay that's very good points and I noted those things the third thing is the physical activity he said that I should really begin if I do like and enjoy using the treadmill for example I ought to consider maybe 20 minutes to start every 29 to 30 days chances are you will develop a habit\nT:\tI don't remember the exact timeframe but it's somewhere around there\nC:\tokay\nT:\tmaybe keep it as a goal just to get there just to get to that\nC:\toh yes yes\nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\teven if you go into the office\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso that's very logic number five the fifth thing you talked about is which was more of an educational piece and you said it was all about calories and you said that what I should be considering is taking in about what would be 500 less calories per day and if I did that it would equate a loss of one pound per week\nT:\tyes\nC:\tand and don't forget to increase your water intake by basically take the five bottles that I basic I was saying that I used to do so start drinking more water and drink water is because carbohydrates attached themselves to water and it is a good idea to reduce carbohydrates are important for the body but at the same time a lower intake of the carbohydrates would probably be helpful in weight loss\nT:\twell it will have to be helpful with water I mean it will result in water weight loss but that's not really fat loss so that removes water weight will come back when you drink a bunch of water again so that's not really the weight loss were looking for we want fat loss\nC:\tokay\nT:\tyou want a decrease in fat and increase in lean mass\nC:\tso I mean how are you gonna lose the fat the yeah the fat loss\nT:\tthrough your diet and just exercising well and\nC:\tbetter choices you write coochie which is basically I always think Roy big steam right\nT:\tyes because three 3\n",
  "﻿T:\thi-oh Vina how are you doing today it's good to see you \nC:\tI'm just tired \nT:\tjust tired yeah you know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq- which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq- and that actually did come up with a score of  which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel \nC:\twell I knew I felt different I didn't know I was depressed \nT:\tbut you knew something was something was wrong \nC:\tI didn't feel like myself or have it and feeling like myself no \nT:\ttell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself \nC:\twhen I just go to work and I come home and I sleep I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired I just have no energy \nT:\tso you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested no not at all doesn't sound like good quality sleep \nC:\tno I just have no energy I don't want to do anything but just sleep \nT:\thow long has\nC:\tthat been going on hmm I guess a couple months  or  months yeah \nT:\twhat else is going on \nC:\tw-well you know I been drinking more I'm a drink socially but I find myself that when I come home you know I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep \nT:\tand that's worrisome to you \nC:\tit is cuz I don't usually drink that often during the week so it's increased yeah yeah \nT:\tI can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with \nC:\tyou well you know my mom died a year ago so Mother's Day is coming up so you never think about mom a lot I miss her a lot \nT:\tthat anniversary is is close \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthat's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time I \nC:\tyeah and I took care of mom so that's hard because for a long time well she was sick and she died from cancer so I took care of her so for a long time that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was so now that she's gone it just kind of brings up everything all over again \nT:\tit's kind of a hole in your life\nC:\tyeah we were really close \nT:\tI'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me I know that's I know that's very difficult so it sounds like your sleep has really been affected you're not getting good quality sleep you're really fatigued yeah I'm just kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day and then how's your appetite been \nC:\tI'm not really eating that much you know so I have energy you know before I would come home cook dinner or you know meet some friends after work but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine just go to bed \nT:\tso you used to be more socially involved than you are now \nC:\tyeah don't do anything now a little  T;\tmore isolated \nC:\tyeah just working come home and sleep \nT:\tso if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do\nC:\twell I don't want to stay like this this isn't Who I am you know just sleeping all the time this is I don't want to stay this way \nT:\tkind of feels like you're stuck yes point \nC:\tyeah I just don't want to do anything or go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep I don't want to do that \nT:\tit's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression\nC:\tokay \nT:\tlike you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point ation \nC:\tno\nT:\tall right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that \nC:\tI'm okay with that you know when Mom was sick you know she was in hospice care so she had cancer and the nurses and the doctors you know had our family talked to someone you know about what we were feeling you know \nT:\tso that was the face pretty good experience\nC:\tyeah yeah to talk to someone that understood what we were going through sure \nT:\tsomething else might be exercised another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those \nC:\tmay be something natural exercise I don't have energy I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything so I know I'm not going to exercise right now but if it's something that's natural you know I can maybe try that \nT:\tokay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too okay so um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she you don't want us out in the community \nC:\tshe was really nice for me yeah I liked her \nT:\tso it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready zero being not ready at all how ready would you be to do some counselling \nC:\tmaybe like a six or seven\nT:\tso a six or seven  why a six or seven and not a four or a five \nC:\twell because I don't want to stay like this and you know I've already talked to her before she was really nice so I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know when I saw her last time if ever needed I could come back \nT:\tso it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good yeah um does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that yeah I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again okay yeah \nT:\twell that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain okay exercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants okay I didn't know that yeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin yeah I asked kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point \nC:\twell if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again does that mean I have to run the medication\nT:\tright now we can try that absolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it well I'll try then let's go on the medication \nC:\tokay I have some friends they exercise and workout that I could probably call and exercise with them \nT:\tso you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program yeah is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group \nC:\tyeah I have friends that run and friends that go to gym I have some friends that walk after work \nT:\tso it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do yeah which of those tend to interest you most\nC:\twell then also you know my church on the weekends they have exercise classes too so yeah but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away\nT:\tvery good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise \nC:\twell when I saw her I could see her after work so I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy and exercise I mean I can do that you know after work or on the weekends my friends they exercise various time so\nT:\tyeah let's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all in  being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing \nC:\thonestly maybe a five okay and I'll try it it say if I have to do that so I have to go on medication then I'll try it okay that\nT:\tsounds like a pretty strong commitment yes I'll try it\nT:\tokay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point\nC:\tthen well you know my friends have been calling but you know I'm just sleeping all the time so when they call them sleep so I haven't really called them back but I know I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and you know at least maybe just start walking \nT:\tI think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call \nC:\tyeah real close close friends that live not too far from me yeah so tell me how to \nT:\ttell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise \nC:\twell I probably shouldn't come home I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friends house after work and change with her \nT:\tit would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening\nC:\tno because it's so hard when I get up in the room so tired that I can't I can't say doing in the morning \nT:\tyou think it would be easier to do it after work \nC:\tcuz I'm already out yeah as long as I don't come home so I come on Monica's sleep come home it's over yeah yeah all right\nT:\twell good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through okay her passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program \nC:\tokay I'll try that \nT:\tall right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working okay  ",
  "﻿T:\thi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up \nC:\twell I came back here because I had to I had to make an appointment so I could get my prescription for my blood pressure medicine refilled and they wouldn't do it it wouldn't refill it it's a drugstore unless I came back here so \nT:\tyou're you're angry what \nC:\twell I'm not angry at you but I'm angry at the situation and I gotta come back in here take time off from work just to get that prescription filled but but you know you do what you got to do and \nT:\twell I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on \nC:\twell uh yeah whenever I get my blood pressure checked at the drugstore it looks like I'm that it's working and that respect but it does seem to take away all my energy you know \nT:\tkind of fatigued \nC:\tyeah yeah my I got no get up and go if you know what I mean\nT:\tso kind of has taken the wind out of your sails \nC:\tabsolutely yeah\nT:\thow long have you noticed that oh I don't know I \nC:\tat least since I've been on this medication at least that long yeah\nT:\tdoesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular \nC:\toh yeah I take it I take it just like it says take it on the bottle you know I take it every morning when I get up \nT:\tokay so you've been pretty consistent and taken the \nC:\tall yes \nT:\tanything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for\nT:\tyour wife  tell me a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you \nT:\twell as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be \nT:\tso sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be \nC:\tnope but I think it's because of that damn medicine \nT:\tso does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively\nC:\twell yeah yeah but you know I I'm worried about my blood pressure because my my mother had a stroke not long ago and I know it was so they told us it was because of her high blood pressure so I don't want that to happen to me \nT:\tsoyou're concerned about having a stroke\nC:\twell yeah I mean would you be you know it sort of runs in families I think \nT:\tyeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you \nC:\tyeah yeah absolutely \nT:\tagain it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay\nC:\twell are you talking about on more medications or just a different medication \nT:\tyeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary \nC:\tyeah well I'm not real interested in adding any more but if changing it it would keep my blood pressure down but not take away all my energy than I might that give better idea \nT:\tso you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes \nC:\tyeah yeah I know \nT:\twell if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense\nC:\tyeah yeah \nT:\tso the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound\nC:\tyeah it sounds though it sounds like a good idea if it still controls my blood pressure but doesn't take away my energy it sounds like a good idea \nT:\tokay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure \nC:\tuh-ohuh-oh my work is sometimes stressful and some of the people I work with kind of drive me a little batty occasionally and I I don't know if it I don't really know if that it causes my blood pressure to go up or not but it certainly could I guess so there's some stressors at work\nT:\tyeah and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of\nC:\tum well you know just mostly from watching TV shows I guess I am aware that alcohol and I drink some a moment that alcohol has some effect on blood pressure I think it might even say so on the label though I'm not sure it can't\nT:\tit can't anything else you can think of\nC:\tno \nT:\twell sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense \nC:\twell yeah \nT:\tso we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but \nC:\twell um exercise I'm I actually like to exercise and \nT:\ttellme about the exercise that you're doing well I play golf and walk the golf course so you carry your bag or do \nC:\tIdrag it along on a pull cart my wife says that that doesn't count as exercise but I say try it yourself it is exercise\nT:\tit is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in yeah and you were about  or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that \nC:\twell I don't think I'm overweight \nT:\tyeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about  to  pounds \nC:\tor  pounds \nT:\tyes  or  pounds \nC:\tI haven't weighed that since I was in high school \nT:\tI understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose  pounds sometimes just a loss of  pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure okay so  pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable \nC:\t\nT:\tis the number okay let's go you do with thigh okay I think I can do  all right so if you were to want to lose  pounds how would you go about it \nC:\tI'd probably go back to the gym\nT:\thas that worked in the past \nC:\tyeah I mean I used to go to the gym and work out a lot and uh I've done it for a while but I guess if if I'm I'm sure I could lose  pounds if I wanted to \nT:\tand that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure \nC:\tokay well \nT:\tsowe've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right \nC:\twell what would it take for me to not have to take the medication at all \nT:\tat all \nC:\tyeah I mean if I did enough exercise and lost enough weight would you not what I not need to take the medicine \nT:\tI I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good \nC:\tI can lose five pounds well \nT:\tit may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one  to  range probably\nC:\tI I just want to make sure I understand if I if if I lose uh five pounds and I do it through exercise that I could you would recommend that I try going without the medicine for a while too and see what happens \nT:\tI don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication \nC:\tyeah if I can yeah \nT:\twell itthere it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight to exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis \nC:\ttwo or three beers a day \nT:\ttwo or three yeah it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you\nC:\tyou're saying two or three more than two more than three okay so two is still considered aa safe and regard to blood pressure \nT:\tthat's what most of the research shows \nC:\tokay I'll do two\nT:\tyou'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day most every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess \nT:\tcan youthink of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis \nC:\toh yeah I guess I could you know I mean uh I you know I don't I I don't have a drinking problem so I could take a day or two and not drink at all if but if if two a day doesn't hurt my blood pressure um I think I could go with that\nT:\tso two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer \nC:\tIsuppose I could drink Light beer \nT:\tlight beer doesn't appeal to you \nC:\tmight as well not drink beer at all you drink Light beer but I suppose if I suppose I could do that \nT:\tscale of zero to ten zero being not willing at all to do that ten being very willing to do that where do you think you \nC:\tprobably about it I \nT:\twhy did you say a five and not a three or four\nC:\tjust because uh you know doc habits are hard to break you know and it usually don't drink Light beer and so it would be a change it would be something different but uh well you know I'm willing to give it a try\nT:\ttell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things well I did you know \nC:\tobviously a good thing is I'd probably lose weight which is what we're trying to do here \nT:\tso you'd lose weight \nC:\tuh and there there may be other things about alcohol that has something to do with blood pressure that I did not understand but but I suppose it would help keep my blood pressure down and my weight low or if I didn't drink as much beer or if I drank light beer and so that's the good side the bad side is I don't like it as much \nT:\ton ascale of zero to ten zero being not very important and ten being very important how important is it for you to to get better control of your blood pressure\nC:\tvery important I put that up really pretty high I'll give that a nine \nT:\tso interms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen\nC:\twell you know I'm willing to do the things but most of what we've just talked about which are um drinking Light beer drinking no more than two beers a day going to the gym again and sticking with a different medicine for a while\nT:\tokay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go\nC:\tyeah I think I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my blood pressure at a level that doesn't concern me and if this is what it takes I'm going to give this a try \nT:\tso one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that \nC:\tsix and a half \nT:\tsix and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three\nC:\tbecause I know when I walk out of here that if I keep doing what I'm doing I I'm either going to have to live with the blood pressure medicine that takes all my energy away and I don't like that or I'm going to have to let my blood pleasure get real high and I know that can cause all sorts of bad things to happen \nT:\tso you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control\nC:\tpeople keep telling me that high blood pressure causes all sorts of bad things to happen so yes I am concerned about\nT:\tthat so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed \nC:\tfive pounds \nT:\tfivepounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month\nC:\tI'm the five pounds going by then my\nT:\tpounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there  ",
  "﻿T:\tmorning page \nC:\thello how are you \nT:\tit's good to see you up and about how are you feeling after your last little hospitalization \nC:\twell it was pretty scary I'm I'm definitely improving but I don't feel as well as I think I should um the COFF is a lot better but my breathing is still not what I think it should be right now \nT:\tso you're you're still struggling to breathe some \nC:\tI guess you could call it struggling I just when I walked to the mailbox or up the stairs I get out of breath easily\nT:\texercise tends to make the breathing worse \nC:\tit does seem so yes \nT:\tso you're better but not quite where you want to be and \nC:\tI'm definitely not where I think I should be I feel like I should be better by now usually after a cough or bronchitis I'm able to breathe easily and it's not like that this time\nT:\tso you usually bounce back pretty quickly but this time is taking longer and that's a that's a real concern to you \nC:\tit was when I was with you in the hospital you gave me a little oxygen in the beginning and I just never thought I would be a person that would have to have oxygen that was scary too\nT:\tso that the oxygen piece is something that scary it almost feels like ear were really really sick when you needed oxygen  C\tit does I never picture myself needing a I guess I'm scared of needing an oxygen tank and carrying it around with me and having the tubes in my nose um that I just don't see myself needing that I always think of myself as being healthy \nT:\tand now it seems like you may have some real or some permanent damage\nC:\tthat's what it seems like \nT:\tPaige would it be okay if we talked a little bit about your disease process \nC:\tsure\nT:\tyou know with a flare-up of bronchitis like this you very well may have done some damage to your lungs the good news is as you continue to heal I mean we have a spirometry today which is that breathing test that you did we compared that  about six months ago it is quite a bit worse now a lot of that will get better with time but also a lot of that kind of depends upon whether you continue to smoke or not \nC:\toh this one we're going to talk about my smoking huh \nT:\twell Paige we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to talk about um those are going to be decisions that only you can make I can't make you quit and so that's just going to have to be your decision I I want you to know though that I'm here to support you and even though we've talked about smoking cessation and some things that you could do in the past you've been kind of resistant about that I wonder if having this bout in the hospital has done anything to change your mind\nC:\twell I think I need to seriously think about it again I just evidently my health is on the line because it it was just a really bad experience for me \nT:\tso bad experience mm-hmm so if we look down the road maybe five ten years and you decided not to quit smoking what do you think that would look like for you\nC:\tprobably not good I would see me not being able to breathe at all and again just my biggest fear would be needing oxygen every day all day that \nT:\toxygen is a pretty strong motivator for you isn't it yeah well so it sounds like if it sounds to me like if if you didn't quit smoking that you feel like your overall health might really be at risk\nC:\tyes \nT:\twhere does that where does that leave you  C\tI need to start considering it more seriously than I have in the past if I want a different outcome if it's\nT:\tokay at this point Paige it's great and but let's talk about it's okay what's something called a decision balance so and involves four things to think about it's almost like writing it on a page but we're going to do it in the air or whatever so what are the good things about smoking that you like if you didn't side to quit what are some of the negatives about smoking if you didn't decide to quit and then if you did quit what would be some of the good things and then what would be some of the negative things if you did quit so tell me if you would what are some of the good things about that you like about smoking if you continue to smoke the way you are \nC:\tokay um I like the taste I like how it feels in my throat I love the social aspect of it I have smoking friends I have non-smoking friends and just when I'm with my friends that smoke it is just a lot of fun it's just something we do as loud as that sounds um and I love it with my coffee first thing whirring a lot \nT:\tso some of the good things are the taste we regularly with coffee and how it makes you feel and then it sounds like there's a big social component to smoking for you there is tell me about then what would be some of the negatives if you continued to smoke and didn't quit \nC:\tmy health that would be the number one things that are negative about smoking the snow and my clothes my hair and that it's a lot of people that are surround myself with it's not socially acceptable anymore and that does make me uncomfortable\nT:\tso some of the negative things would be it's a impact on your health right the the smell clothes and so forth and then there's a lot of kind of social pushback\nC:\tyes there is \nT:\twith cigarette smoking I see what else \nC:\twell you know my husband Dan recently stopped smoking and was it yeah he's done quite well but now it's seems like he's righteous and I'm an addict and he says things like you could just do it if you'll just do it you know what those cigarettes are gonna do to you why don't you just stop I tell them I've stopped a hundred times and I'll stop when I'm ready but it you know that's put a strain on things \nT:\tit does sound like he's concerned about you and and concerned about your health and that he loves you \nC:\tI know it just doesn't feel that way sometimes but I know that he would be supportive because he wants what's best for me \nT:\tbut it's on the other hand it's it's hard to put up with some of that stuff and I think I think it shows a lot of inner strength in you to put up with some of that even though it's kind of a pain \nC:\twell thank you I'd like to think so\nT:\tso what would be some of the positives some of the good things about quitting based on what you told me here today\nC:\teven if I have some permanent damage you encouraged me to believe that if I stopped that I could get better and definitely avoid the oxygen tank that would be the biggest positive the second positive was that Dan and I would have a little more peace in our home and get along better and he would see that I you know want to be on the planet my clothes would smell better my hair would smell better a car would smell better I wouldn't have to worry about you know sneaking somewhere when I wanted to smoke and it wasn't socially acceptable in the situation I'm in so there are a lot of positives okay\nT:\tso again on one hand there are a lot of good things that you enjoy about smoking and on the other hand there you've given me quite a list of things that if you did quit there would be a lot of ways that your life would be better so where does that leave you now \nC:\tbut I just really need to do this and to concentrate on the good things and just be ready to stop I just need to stop \nT:\tsounds like you're pretty committed so honest let's talk about a scale then on in terms of being ready to quit zero being not ready at all and ten being like yeah I'm really ready to quit where are you on that do you think \nC:\tI'm gonna say an eight \nT:\tan eight why an eight not a five or six \nC:\tit all just goes back to this recent event and the fears that I have or where it would be I'll go back to your five to ten years from now and that's just not\nT:\tnot a pretty picture no no it's not tell me some of the things that you are aware of that can help you in this quest\nC:\twell I'm very familiar with nicotine gum and nicotine patches I do wear the patch and they work very well for me um especially at work because I'm not allowed to smoke at work nor but I want to be smoking at work again with the people that I'm with um and that's really about all I've ever tried or called Turkey and that just never will I never want to offer you mm-hmm\nT:\tdo you know about the NC quit line \nC:\tI've heard the commercials on the radio but I've never looked into it \nT:\twould it be okay if we talked about that for a minute sir this is a fantastic program page they have a lot of information but the great thing is you can actually have your own personal smoking counselor and you can call them or you can leave a message with them to call you but there's a tremendous amount of support there and that's been a very helpful thing and the great thing for me is they will actually call me and give me kind of follow-up information on how you're doing mmm how does that how does it sound \nC:\tsounds very intriguing sounds like it could be helpful yeah not just depend on Dan with my journey yeah \nT:\tso he's just uh sounds like more support right you wouldn't feel you wouldn't feel alone in this battle right yeah so I heard the nicotine patches and gum and then possibly the Quitline anything else that you've heard about or that you might be interested in there\nC:\twell I do know Dan um had a quit date is that something I have to do \nT:\tagain decisions that only you can make H and but if it's okay I can tell you a little bit about the research about the quit date okay um most of the research shows that if indeed you can kind of look at your calendar and see a time that would be better to quit them than not it's really helpful to have a quit date and to tell as many people as you can about that this is the day I'm quitting again it tends to garner that social support and increases the commitment level how does that sound\nC:\twell that makes sense why it would be better than just today will be the day\nT:\tis there any time that would be better for you to get a quit date than another day \nC:\twe do have some plans coming up so I think a week from Monday socially would be better that's the day a week from it yes \nT:\twould it be okay if our office called you on that day to just begin to give you a little bit more support let you know that we're with you sure that would begin so let's go back to another one of those scales scale of  to  in terms of your confidence about doing this zero being no confidence  being they have a lot of confidence about my ability to quit where would you be on that scale \nC:\tI think with everything we discussed today I would like to leave on a  and that's how I feel that's tremendous it is tremendous good good feels good feels I could still be a little weary\nT:\tbut it feels good \nC:\tyeah but it feels like you have a play on this time good as what I feel better \nT:\twell congratulations I think that's probably the biggest health decision that you could possibly make in your life particularly in light of what you've just been through so right I think this is a really good time and I have I applaud your courage doing it takes a lot to to make this decision so good for you \nC:\twell thank you \nT:\tso I will call you and we'll give you some information about the Quitline when you leave you can take care of the patches and and gums instead of over-the-counter and if it's okay let's schedule an appointment and two to three weeks out and get you back and see how things are going  ",
  "﻿T:\thi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by\nC:\twell I came today because my daughters in the hospital as well I think it's important to quit but I enjoy smoking I'm not ready to give it up right now my life is too much in turmoil\nT:\tso I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about \nC:\tI think it's important because I i feel i'm a bad role model for my children and my daughter is turning  and are ready some of her friends have tried smoking so I don't want her to think it's a good thing \nT:\tso the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking \nC:\tIsmoked when I was young and I certainly don't want it for her \nT:\tand it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately \nC:\twell that's true it seems so hard I'm just not ready for this right now \nT:\tso Center what's good about smoking what do you like about it\nC:\tit's very enjoyable relaxing you know it stress reliever when I'm at work we all go out and smoke and chitchat and you know talk about things I would hate to not smoke really I'd be left out \nT:\twhat else tell me what else is good about it\nC:\tmmm I like to have a cigarette after i eat it sort of tells my brain I'm finished stop eating I'm full so it's it's a way to you know sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack so it's a way to control my weight \nT:\tokay so is there anything else that you like about it\nC:\tlet me think well I just enjoy it I think it's um it's not good for me I know but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much \nT:\tso let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out okay so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke \nC:\tthat's true yeah \nT:\tyou also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you were we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up yeah I also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking \nC:\texactly \nT:\tso I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not so good thing \nC:\twell I I'm worried about my children I feel like I'm being a bad parent and I often wonder you know they've seen me smoke for years I certainly don't want my twelve-year-old daughter to start smoking and some of her friends are already smoking \nT:\tSandracan you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her \nC:\tyeah just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up there she was looking out the window watching me smoke\nT:\tso this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you \nC:\tI felt terrible you know I was projecting I want to be a good parent and I don't feel this really is part of the plan \nT:\tand again thanks for your honesty and talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know the one hand you talked about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter mm-hmm and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together \nC:\tit doesn't fit you know it's the opposite side of the coin you know I love to do it but I don't think it's right \nT:\tso what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you  C\tI can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about\nT:\tso it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me exactly okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful oh sure\nC:\tsure I'll come in yes \nT:\tgood talk about tomorrow not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you're willing to do that can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week I promise it's not too time-consuming we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change why you would even consider quitting smoking and then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days \nC:\tokay okay I'll give it a try \nT:\tokay here you go thank you so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week all right  ",
  "﻿T:\tshe is good to see you again \nC:\thello Doctor \nT:\tso what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago\nC:\twell I did what we discussed I did the journal okay a week trying to mark down the the difference in my smoking being more aware when I would had the urge if I could stop the urge and I found it was okay it got a little bit scary on the weekend because the urge is kept on coming sure to have a cigarette butt during the week I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week and that's just in one week so \nT:\tso you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes that's amazing I mean given how much you were smoking yeah you were able to keep the the journal you guys like you did that and that allowed you to really focus on the time when we were delaying your secret so so that's gone well so one of the things that are not going as well as you'd liked \nC:\tit just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend right and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day instead of at work and I found that it was really hard to stop those urges \nT:\tok so these automatic cigarettes when you're socializing and you have time on your hands really other problems that you're facing yes and that you've noticed other more difficult than the others \nC:\tbut I marked it in the book that's one thing I said to myself I'll be honest in my marking been walking down ok so I'm going to have to really be aware of the weekends maybe get some kind of hobby or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy \nT:\tok so and you thought about already what you might do is such as getting a hobby any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this \nC:\tif I could just postpone it ok and say okay I'm not gonna have it at home right I'll have it when i get to work or on the way to work that because I sure and then what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house \nT:\tok so from now to the next time you come back and see me what is it that you'd like to to work on  C\tI think I just like to do what I did this first week I like the idea of marking it down ok so you can continue with that I and it took me a week and I i'm down to cigarettes a day I figure sure what I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes in other words another three a day okay and because I smoked a large pack in a small pack maybe just two small packs \nT:\tyou said five cigarettes this time yes and any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen\nC:\tI can try each day to count right and I'm still going to try that when I get the urge to let it go fight it and maybe not goat for cigarette until the next urge comes right so if i look at it between two of them sure and also coming back and talking to you really helps because i have someone to discuss it with \nT:\tso given what you're attempting to do when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this \nC:\tI wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and a week I can handle a week\nT:\tabsolutely okay okay doctor will see you in a week yes thank you  ",
  "﻿T:\thi gene I'm dr. sabe nice to meet how can I help you today \nC:\twell doctor I made an appointment with you finally because I was diagnosed over three months ago with the pulmonary disease COPD yes and although I didn't call right away I really need some help in quitting smoking right so I thought well this is my first step so it's time to do something \nT:\tsomething okay so you've been diagnosed by this progress brother just diagnosed that and and how are you feeling right now \nC:\tI'm I'm really scared because I don't feel well I haven't felt well for a while I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers\nT:\tit sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened \nC:\tmm-hmm I I don't know what I'm going to do about it okay\nT:\tno have you thought about when you want to quit\nC:\tfine I'm giving myself six months six months and and that seems like a long time away but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time I don't even have % faith in myself \nT:\tokay so what I'm hearing you say is that although you want to quit smoking in the next six months you're feeling a bit under confident that you'll actually be able to do this and your word about failing \nC:\tI don't know what to do I've tried to quit smoking I've had I've taken pills I've taken the patch I've gone through therapy nothing's helped I finally I went to the doctor I was actually in the hospital they took me to the hospital for a week that's the longest I quit \nT:\tso you've been able to quit smoking but only when you were in the hospital \nC:\tI had no choice I have no choice and then next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked okay\nT:\tlet me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with this could you tell me what is good about smoking for you\nC:\tit's part of my life it's I started smoking when I was   at home my parents smoked all their friends smoked it was on television everybody looks so grand smoking and all dressed up and and fancy clothes and had me be having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal I didn't really think about it's just an extension of me I guess it's good for my nerves right I mean I feel like it is I know when I've got a package in my pocket or I know if I'm going through some stress I say oh I'll have a cigarette and think this out sure\nT:\tso gene I want to make sure that I understood what you've told me of what do you find good about smoking so it helps you calm down it gives you something to do it's been part of your image you feel sophisticated you feel like a movie star in fact the way you talk about it seems like that's what it makes you feel like is that right that's right okay is there anything I missed\nC:\tum I enjoyed it just it relaxes me it's great after a meal yes um free mm-hmm we all just do it it's a little group of people my family right the people I work with we go out in the courtyard have a cigarette and talk that's how you make friends a lot of people would like a little group now we're all a little bunch of us \nT:\tso it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you're smoking and it's so easy to go and take a break and have a cigarette\nC:\tI I never thought of it that way but probably you're right now \nT:\tyou've told me what is good about smoking for you ah can you tell me what it's not so good about smoking for you \nC:\twell it's bad for my health and it's scaring because I don't feel well I haven't felt well for a while I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers\nT:\tis there anything else that's not good abouts looking for you \nC:\tum it's expensive really god expensive and I smoked  sometimes  cigarettes a day and I'm starting to buy a different makeup because I'm starting to really age starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics \nT:\tokay so let me make sure I've understood this piece as well so they're not good things on the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health the effects on your physical appearance on how you look and the amount of investment that you do making in makeup and in getting your nails done etc and then the cost of smoking yes so so let me ask you this given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of  to  where  is the most important thing to do and one would be the least important thing to do how important is it for you to quit smoking \nC:\tit's for me for my health and for the money and everything I said I would say it's  or out of  that I should quit smoking \nT:\tdefinitely most important \nC:\tyes a hundred percent one of the most important things \nT:\tlet me ask another question and follow-up to that again given everything going on where  is the most confident you ever felt about anything and one is the least confident how confident are you that you will be able to quit \nC:\tum I'd say  or  percent confident sorrowful yeah I'd like to say more but um \nT:\tokay now help me understand why you said  and not something like  or  because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit \nC:\twell I'm I guess I'm still a fighter and III it's starting - I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you so this was big step so I guess yes it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week okay\nT:\tso you've said  to  percent what would it take to build that confidence to about % \nC:\tmaybe if I could come to see you again or maybe some ideas were suggested maybe if there was a group or something I I don't know but I need some help\nT:\tso if you got help that would help you say that you went from % to % \nC:\tI think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today okay discussing things helps me I always feel better when I get things out okay\nT:\tso Jean I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important for a step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time but as the first small step I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week and the reason why I say that is because as you were mentioning to me smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act and I notice that you were saying to me you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes and sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing and that's often the first small step what are your thoughts about that\nC:\tin other words think about it more don't don't just do it automatically \nT:\tthat's correct and writing it down helps that process\nC:\tyeah I think so because and when I get the urge I could maybe fight it and maybe wait till the next urge and maybe mark that down that I didn't go right away when something went wrong and yes I can try that \nT:\tokay and I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it and then if you can bring that back to the next appointment it could be something we could discuss okay anything else \nC:\tno that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week\nT:\texcellent well thank you so much for coming in today and thank you for seeing me doctor you're welcome  ",
  "﻿T:\table to come in it's just great you know we haven't seen you in like six months how have you been girl\nC:\tthey've been doing a little better yes\nT:\twe'll talk about that you know it looks like on here that your ac is down a little bit I think it's down to about ten now yeah so you've really been making some progress tell me about how it's been going \nC:\twell I do exercise a lot more I exercise a lot more yes I have my little portion controls they don't have too much of a certain food I make sure that you know I have my insulin at the right time the right amount \nT:\tso it sounds like you've really been doing a couple different things that have been working for you it's exercising more which I want to hear about and you've been really looking more at your portion sizes yes you know those measuring pieces we had talked to talk some time about yes and then the third one is Oh taking your insulin at the right times okay I'm really the schedule on where it is yes does that seem to be making you feel better as far as the insulin or what do you noticing \nC:\tum I'venoticed that well I'm very sure we discussed this before when I used to go out I used to just kind of check my blood sugar and make sure that it was low enough to have whatever I kind of wanted to okay I see right yes well now I mean I still go friends of course but as you should as I said um but one like once I go out now I kind of I tried looking for something like if my friends are gonna have a candy bar or something I try looking for maybe a granola bar or something that's a that's like sort of like a candy bar but it's a little healthier and I know that it won't rise my blood sugar that much \nT:\tso you've been looking for other alternatives so you still feel like you're doing one but they're doing I'm looking at the carbs a little or seeing where it would be with your sugars \nC:\tyeah like I mean of course I'm teenager I still love candy or whatever but \nT:\tnobody can stop you from having candy completely exactly \nC:\tbut you know I still try go to go out and have fun I mean even though my friends do eat whatever they kind of want I just I take better better care of myself I eat something healthier it's something that'll make me feel more energetic instead of like a little sugar rush and then just crash later on \nT:\tso you know how you feel when you get that sugar rush and cry yes that feeling hasn't been something you've enjoyed in the past yeah so you've you've been feeling a little more even keel it sounds like how that's going so talking about the exercise piece you say you've been exercising more what have you been enjoying \nC:\twell now that I'm in school I mean I tried out for the basketball team yeah hey yes\nT:\toh I know you said you're really looking forward to that\nC:\tyes and it's a lot of fun I enjoy it the workouts are pretty harsh but I like it I have fun I enjoy it and you haven't been feeling as though your sugar that you want to crash during checkouts\nT:\tyou've been able to manage while you're out with your energy level \nC:\tyeah I mean I always keep some fast-acting sugar on me just in case super I'm glad crash \nT:\tand that had added something you've had to use or haven't had to use during exercise also know how good deal good so you've been able to kind of go into it with the right sugar level yes so that you haven't bottom doubt \nT:\twell with all these things that you've been working on so well what what's your main goal right now what's something that you're you know really trying to be focused on for you \nC:\twell my main goal is well I've lowered my ac a little bit but I'm trying to get it to where it's really actually supposed to be so that sure myself healthy you know\nT:\tso so keep moving in that direction we've got it from a from a  down to a  which is a huge success in the time period that we've been looking at and maybe let's try to move it down even a little further to you know nine to start and move down to an age exactly okay so that's that's that's great so the bigger goal is getting the ac down a little and then these smaller pieces are your what you're doing to make that happen yes so how important is it for you to have an ac let's say eight in the next six months on a scale of one to ten kinda like that pain scale we use where would you put yourself on a scale of one to ten just how important it is \nC:\tI would actually have to say about an eighth\nT:\tit's an eighth Wow so it's not a two or three it's an eighth\nC:\tmy goal I want I really want to reach my goal I want to be able to feel good and you know I want to make sure that I know that I'm healthy and that I know I was the one who did this for myself \nT:\tbut you said it wasn't about your mom it wasn't about dr. Smith but it was about what Elizabeth wanted yes so what would it take to move you just a little bit higher up to a nine as far as importance what would have to happen \nC:\tI'm not really sure actually I mean it's really important to me but I do have you know has to have school and sports exactly you know I have to worry about other things too \nT:\twe all have a lot of things we're juggling and to be honest I don't think anyone can ever really be a ten in terms of importance because we have all these things that we have to manage and sometimes they're higher up and sometimes they're lower up depending on the day or even the minute so I'm that same kind of scale of  to  where would you put yourself in terms of how confident you are that you can bring down your ac - what did we say at  within the next six months how confident are you that you can make that happen \nC:\tabout a  actually \nT:\tWow yeah wow that is awesome so tell me about that \nC:\twell I'm really comfident because I mean if I was able to get my blood my ac from  to  and only a couple of months yes I've believed that I can do the same thing again thank you what I'm doing up \nT:\tsoreally just continuing to do what you're doing you've already shown here in the last few months that you've dropped it substantially and I'm sure you were really excited to get to see that score you know to see what the number was really gonna be \nC:\tyeah it made me feel really good I know that I'm doing better and that I'm healthier so \nT:\tdid you have a sense when you came in did you have an idea of what you thought your number might be \nC:\tI did actually because I know that before I wasn't doing as well as I I could and by pushing myself I knew that you know what I know it's lower I know that I did good and I've been taking care of myself I know it's most definitely lower okay\nT:\tso you could feel confident coming in at hey when I see that number I already know the work I've been doing so it darn well better be lower because yes we're not put into this so that makes sense it sounds like for you just continue to do what you're doing continue on with getting onto the basketball team and you know continuing on with those things you're playing out with your with your insulin you haven't been in the hospital now for over  months so I mean that's you know that's a huge progress in success as far as keeping yourself stable and feeling good and enjoying high school yeah so how bout we check back again you know an hour another  days and just kind of see where that the ac is then yeah and kind of go from there and you know if you have any questions or you're not sure about something by all means you can stop and that's what we're here for okay thanks Liz it's great talking to you today it's great down you too you  ",
  "﻿T:\tlittle bit of information as to why you're here but but maybe you can go ahead and just tell me \nC:\tyeah well my wife basically just said if I don't get um final stop drinking then she's leaving \nT:\tWow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it \nC:\tyeah yeah she said you know she's told me for a long time that she doesn't like it and our kids have said they don't like it she's never she's kind of threatened it but I think she needs it this time I don't\nT:\tokay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things and now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty yeah she just wants me to stop pretty out of about it okay so what do you think \nC:\twell I'm thinking that I've worked hard my whole life and I should be able to to drink if I want but you know I don't you know I never been arrested you know I've got I've done really good with the money that we have you know we live a pretty good life she gets to do what you wanted I get to do what I want and this is just something that I want to do so you know I and it's been that that you know I've been drinking since I think we met yeah we can vary it a long time oh so I don't know what I I'm kind of like I know what the big deal is really and all right I don't want to quit\nT:\twhat's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up \nC:\tyeah I don't like it people tell me what to do yeah no no usually I just usually if someone tells me what to do like tell him to back off wouldn't what to do and so but she's serious it's time so I don't know what to do\nT:\tso all right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hands you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned \nC:\twell she says she's worried about my health you know cuz I have high blood pressure you know worried about because my dad died of a heart attack at a really early age so she's afraid I'm just gonna I'm just gonna drop dead you know I outlive my dad by so many years and I you know and again it's my life yeah so yeah \nT:\tyeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want right you know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that\nC:\tbut but you know everybody's got their choices to make in this situation\nT:\tokay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and\nC:\tthat's but I was really little okay when when he died so I don't know \nT:\tso you're not sure if that we died of heart attack okay you know so you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not I probably did probably crank song but so you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking \nC:\tyeah the dollar I've said I should quit drinking the dog or they know okay you're not convinced but with the dog don't exactly that  years ago I need to quit drinking and\nT:\tokay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking  years ago and here you are it's still alive then \nC:\tI pretty much do whatever I want when I yeah you know surely no life because the way it's been I've given everybody wrong yeah of everybody okay Wow\nT:\tokay so you feel like you know you beaten the odds so else you can say the live \nC:\tyeah you can say that okay max I'll work my way up I'm working my way up and once really high up my confident for a retiree okay huh you've always thought I would do it\nT:\tso it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life is right it seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so \nC:\tum  and she doesn't get she doesn't she wasn't I don't think she recognized how hard I worked for it to have what we have okay you know and I wish she just let me live the life I've always wanted to live you know and then part of its drinking I like drinking so okay \nT:\tokay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guide it sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like yeah is it it's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth \nC:\twell I would yeah because it might kill other people but I'm not going to let kill me\nT:\tokay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now yeah okay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now\nC:\tif I if I tell you what I'm really thinking are you tell my wife but \nT:\tno no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking I do not assess us but you know\nC:\tI think you you I think you kind of get me kind understanding so I really you know my um my son's in AAA okay and and you know when he went into his treat treatment and he really was hard on me like he said that he blamed me for him you know get you know going down that path and and and I really felt like maybe I could have done more he and i were really close now we're not as close because he I can tell you this doesn't like to be around me as I drink and my daughter is she sent me a letter a while ago saying that she loved me and that she didn't want me to die and wanted my kids to be around her but her kids to be around me but she um she didn't want him around as much because cuz she didn't like it when I'm drinking so well so yeah I've had I've had those couple things that that maybe go maybe maybe that maybe I need to rethink this yeah and then I'm always one way and that's really like I still want to lose her I just don't\nT:\twell you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that  thank thanks for talking again together I'll be hopping your straight shooter or I really appreciate that\nT:\talright okay thank you very much thanks easy  ",

Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something\nT:\tyeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that\nC:\tI suppose okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit he told me to fill that out and bring it with me \nT:\tokay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting typically yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive \nC:\twinewith my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four  so my stress is increased \nT:\tso starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that okay okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot \nC:\tI fill the glass up so maybe a little more than\nT:\tyeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and / in one week so in total how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that mmm\nT:\tso what do you make of all that \nC:\twell that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive\nT:\tyeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol \nC:\twell you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what \nT:\tso you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those not so good things about alcohol for you \nC:\tum well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden yeah \nT:\tso your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking \nC:\tyeah kind of defeating the purpose there  the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses\nT:\tso the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more \nC:\tmaybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress \nT:\tyeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele\nC:\tI thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot\nT:\tI'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of  through  i below the visual here with that if zero is not important ten is very important to do something about your drinking \nC:\tway mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a \nT:\tmm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a  or a  or  \nC:\twell again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and \nT:\tso you know all those responsibilities there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale\nC:\tum well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress\nT:\tyeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking \nC:\tI'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight \nT:\tokay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit\nC:\tjust in case but you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time \nT:\tso you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit \nC:\twell again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well\nT:\tit sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress \nC:\twell I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of \nT:\tone of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone that'd be nice right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future all right thank you very much you're welcome  ",
  "﻿T:\tthen tell me what's been happening since we last spoke \nC:\twell I did get an interview for a job \nT:\tthat's so great \nC:\tyeah but I wasn't able to go because my kids I didn't have any one to watch them and you know so that was sort of game over I just I had to cancel the interview and this it's too bad because it was really actually was a job that would have been good but I don't know \nT:\tsound disappointed\nC:\twell yeah because it's it's you know I didn't really have a choice I just have to be have to make sure my kids are taken care of first and you know worried that this is going to keep happening\nT:\tit's going to keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities yeah well tell me honest go from one to ten and how important is it for you to get a job \nC:\tit's it's about out of ten because yeah I mean I'm the only one supporting my kids and you know it's just I what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it so I really need to have job and soon \nT:\tyeah you're you're it yep you have to provide for your children and tell me how to skip from one to ten how confident are you that you can get a job\nC:\tI mean right now I think I'm bad with a three I just seems like you know even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare you know when I show up I've got this resume that it's it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job so I just feel like I'm not I don't know that employable \nT:\tso it sounds like the childcare issue has been getting in the way into finding something would work for you would be really helpful and then also it sounds like you're kind of feeling not so great about your resume and your experience\nC:\tyeah yeah because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working I mean it's not I don't know it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now\nT:\tokay what is it that you want \nC:\tI just want something that is is going to be steady and where I can me you know even if my kids are in childcare during the day that can be home every night and spending time with them and I really like to get something where I'm just making good money and and I don't have to worry all the time about money yeah \nT:\tso if you have if you had consistent work it would change your life in a lot of ways yeah it would be huge it would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much\nC:\tyeah and it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine right\nT:\tso everyday you know where you're going yeah okay and you know what's what's happening for the day for the week right\nC:\tone it would be good if I knew you know that my kids are taking care of - yeah so I'm not worried about them law in the work right yeah \nT:\tbecause you're you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well great yeah um so tell me what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence to feel a little bit more confident getting work\nC:\twell I mean being able to make the interviews would be the priority again um so try you know taking care having some child care I mean having someone I trust that I can call when I you know what that interview because you definitely need to go to an interview of in order to get three\nT:\tyeah yeah so having taken care of that part having some reliable child care \nC:\tyeah definitely not\nT:\twhat else would get five \nC:\tum I just wish that I had I had more experience or um you know more education it seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume okay I get asked about education and training and um you know just as soon as I asked about it I just feel just like I'm not good enough okay this does not have that\nT:\tyeah so if you had something on a resume that was around education training maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in that you would feel proud of yourself yeah well something I could talk about\nC:\tyeah the interview too you know even if I was some type of certification where I could say I could you know with confidence talk about about that mm-hmm\nT:\tokay what do you have any ideas as to what feels you might be interested in getting some more education more training \nC:\tI mean I guess I just don't really know what it's going to be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure like what's going to be fast right I almost feel like that's more importance and what I'm interested in you know because I'm like I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now\nT:\tokay and so if if you were it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd want to do something really quickly like \nC:\tyeah short a short certificate yeah or something yes something that I could get immediate skills that would you know get me into some kind of a job now even if it's not my long-term goal or you know career just just get me into something and then I how focused on yeah sort of like a short-term or transition into something else yeah great exactly but that would be steady and pays well mm-hmm okay and allow you to afford everything ya need to because even those jobs right now I don't feel accessible for me they seem like you know seems like if maybe if I were better on the computer or\nT:\tokay you know specifically getting some computer skills to help \nC:\tyeah I think so okay I think so because I don't I can't I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about the technology yeah okay\nT:\tso whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one and then once you're there at the interview feeling more confident about your skills getting some child reliable child care certainly sounds very important yeah as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers yeah that would be great okay okay great\nT:\tso what would you like to do next you\nC:\tthink well I'll find the childcare resources is seems to be the batsman's of it that's a priority the priority because I can't even do an interview without that yeah and then I guess getting into some type of some type of a training program that's you know shortly maybe there's a weekend  ",
  "﻿T:\tLisa are you doing \nC:\tI'm all right just a little tired today alright well \nT:\tso what's what's going on\nC:\tI'm just sick and tired I won't have a regular life or normal life like everybody else and it's very it's just I'm just so sick of nobody's helping me I do everything by myself and you know I have all these kids you know they running around and you know acting crazy and i'm just i'm tired of but they'd out of my husband he runs around and do what he do and I was just sick and tired of having it live like this I thought you know as a child when I grow up as an adult life is gonna be so much better but it's not it's it's just like whatever well I don't do what I can to try to make sure my kids have with a\nT:\twell so you're doing your best but but pretty pretty disappointed in the way things are for you these nights not seeing a whole lot of its kind of kind it is kind of your life isn't it I mean you guys kids what it is \nC:\ti mean i have to make sure that i take care of them I'm because who else will I don't have anybody to help me I have no support yeah I have to make sure they get well\nT:\tfor spore small kids and one of them being baby nuts and \nC:\tshe's all over the place I mean she's pulling down stuff and and is how to go behind and pick it up and so now just they forget it just let her throw it down on floor oh my\nT:\tgosh gets to a point where you pretty much give up \nC:\tyeah and I'm just sitting in just watcher and I make sure she doesn't get anything in her mouth \nT:\twith still having the priority of you know safety you know you're still looking out for her that way but it's kind of gotten you you're getting kind of worn down\nC:\tyeah I am I am sometime I just feel you know like I don't want to live and I'm like what if I don't I'm not here you know there maybe it'll be better but then I start thinking it can you know gosh these kids are here you know my husband is not doing what he's supposed to do so who's gonna take care of my mom is getting older and I I'll try to tough it out\nT:\toh gosh I'm sorry it's getting that point pretty pretty pretty helpless\nC:\tI am I just try to deal with y'all smell that what we need you in there and it relaxing me I'm the chilling and you know I'm on cloud nine for a minute but then I commenter Errol in this deal here\nT:\tprovides maybe a temporary temporary escape but it never doesn't change anything all right so whatever what are some other things that you're doing that maybe you feel are helpful \nC:\twell nothing really i like the right and i really do i like to write but I don't write I like to read but I don't really read it much so um you know I try to write and I just don't have time it to get tired and I Spit on the bed and or I was sitting on a chair fall asleep but look at TV and so probably smoking smoking me home I don't really like to drink much but I might I'm gonna change them socially have a dream\nT:\twell its own so long and so you liked it you like to read and you liked write yeah and and kind of the classic thing that happens right when you when you start to feel depressed when you start to really get depressed that's exactly what happens the things that we really enjoy the things that really fulfill us are the things that we that we start to not do anymore even though it's like even though you know you've always enjoyed it I you just don't feel like doing you just kind of get to a point where you're like just you know it's not like I saw you perk up I mean you talk about it your eyes just lit up you know the way you talk about you like to write and you have a passion there so it sounds like that's something that if you if you were doing that that would be an indication that you're you're doing better you feel good \nC:\tyeah i think i would but when i have time yeah and that's not a thing I say well maybe I could do it at night when I put the kids to be a nigger but then you know we're getting somewhere I can't die on the paper you know it might be over there my notebook is somewhere else and I just say well you know I may be good tomorrow right \nT:\twell I and I think we all experience that I mean it's that kind of you know even though it's something you like sometimes it's it does take kind of taught it does take time and it takes energy and when you're tired you know you don't always feel like it and that's part of it too is it that you know i i'm sure the writing in and of itself is a very rewarding thing but then it's in order to write you have to have time to yourself and it sounds like that's something that you sure don't have much\nC:\tno and you think feels gonna come in here and i'll take the key it so i can write no this is outside playing with motorcycles and cars and you know and probably chasing women I don't know but you know it's just crazy so he's not going to do anything I thought husband supposed to be son Isaac suppose we ate or he'll miss fortune\nT:\twell I heard you mentioned earlier something about your husband some concerns you're having about the relationship so so maybe just to get a sense of there are a few things going on I mean one is you've got the feet feeling pretty down feeling pretty down feeling pretty overwhelmed with being a home all the time with the kids and not having time for yourself not having a break not being able to get away so one is you don't have the time to get away like you don't have many opportunities when you do you're pretty well exhausted and don't really feel like doing the things that you have enjoyed in the past like reading and writing and then so one of the things you've done to try to cope is is smoking marijuana which you know seems to help for a little bit but then when you come back it's everything's the same and so it seems like you're not getting a tremendous amount out of that and then you've got your husband who you're in this you know you've got real concerns real questions about what's going on with him and you're not feeling entirely supported and and you've got questions about its fidelity alright\nC:\tthat's another story we'll be here all day okay all right well \nT:\tso out of everything out of all of that I mean what do you think is the thing that how do you think we could best use our time\nC:\tI just want to be normal that's one of a normal life but I guess just give me just wanting to probably started out looking for a job I need a job right now so that was probably  I didn't really mean it early but that's I needed a job okay well it's certainly a star Oh kind of be a star all right \nT:\tso certainly I mean that would influence a lot of the other things and I mean that would hell I'm you'd be getting out of the house and you have money and all those kinds of things any of you thought about kind of like how that would work in terms of taking care of the baby if you had a job you'd be able to maybe someone to help out with the beach \nC:\tI think well I told my husband that he's gonna have to step up and you know I'll be willing to get a third shift but he's gonna step up and you know take care of the baby throughout the night okay so then when the kids get up for school I'm coming home and he just get them up and with hair and family it's kind of taken alone all right so I have thought about \nT:\tyeah you got you've got a real plan in mind okay i just got to get out then the four job okay i have all my right of the main everything is ready but I just Evan at a time\nT:\tok ok thank you  ",
  "﻿T:\tI can't how you doing today \nC:\tI'm doing all right not doing so bad are you done today\nT:\tnothing thanks for asking what brings you in \nC:\tum so my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper and she saw like out of some of the things that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that that I smoke so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you so I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it \nT:\tso you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you \nC:\tyeah I mean it's just it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like that's it I can spend like  minutes with you compared to hours of her nagging me through the week so\nT:\tso you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in \nC:\tyeah I mean it's covered by insurance it's just  minutes of my time but\nT:\tand what she would like you to do and this is her goal not yours would be to stop smoking\nC:\tyeah\nT:\ttell me what your goal is \nC:\tI mean I don't really have one like I I don't think smoking is that bad well I mean I don't know smoking can be bad but like it doesn't it's never bothered me like I I don't know it's like I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having her cell phone you may \nT:\tso do you have a goal of quitting smoking \nC:\tyeah no there's no there's like so many good things about smoking like what really got me into it was I smoked a lot of work because it gives me like one-on-one time with the boss so like the fact that I can get that time with my bosses I make a little bit worth it \nT:\tcan you tell me does some of the other good things possible \nC:\tum it's just like it's how I meet people so like if I like I'll have cigarettes on me but like I don't have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from fishing off the pack because I could fish off a pack a day but if I don't have a lighter than like I carry the cigarettes around with me and then if I see other people are smoking I can go and ask for a light and that's always kind of like a way in to get to these groups and like I've just met so many different people from from smoking like \nT:\tso smoking the way you're presenting it there's been a positive thing in your life \nC:\tyeah I mean I'm like I want to do it socially so that's yeah \nT:\tare there any negative aspects to smoking\nC:\tI mean yeah I mean I one you everyone knows smoking is unhealthy but like I don't I don't smoke a lot like I only only smoke from time to time but it's mostly just on the weekends so it's like I don't know in case you buy smoker for the weekends I might have like a coffee maybe like a heavy a call from Mondays Tuesdays part of me is gone by Wednesday so it's not really that big of a deal\nT:\tyou don't seem like you're too worried about the the negative aspects \nC:\tno I mean like the obviously is unhealthy but like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons I think \nT:\tso let me ask you a question I want you to give a response between - this is called scaling and is to do it the importance of stopping smoking so one would be it's not important to you and  would be it's extremely important where do you think you'd put that number\nC:\tI don't know maybe like like a - like it'd be cool if you order the coffee on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from sweating \nT:\tso not particularly important\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tnow let me ask you the same question except instead of importance how confident or how about confidence how confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale once to have one being not confident all and ten being extremely confident \nC:\tI could say probably like an eight or a nine like I could I could give it up actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that so I just starting up again but I don't know right like if I really wanted to give it up for good I'm sure I could \nT:\tsostopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided you would so based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking what would be a goal how could we spend this time so that it would be productive \nC:\tI don't know like I guess who would it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend like like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you you seen you kind of seem like you get it so like I don't know maybe you figure out ways to like explains or her the things that I get from smoking to like I don't just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself \nT:\tso to help her to understand why the smoking works for you yeah that's that's one goal there any other goals you could think of I mean you came in in part because you're well soon here like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured it yeah so any other relational goals so my work on there\nC:\tI don't know we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking mm-hmm so I think like maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't understand that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always and like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us living in the house but like I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days it's a\nT:\tproductive communication and productive arguments right yeah yeah so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend where actually understands how important it is to you yeah because it does seem like it's really important but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument feel like you're not in a stalemate right \nC:\tyeah yeah that's gonna be cool all right\nT:\twell you want to make those the goals that we work one so that we can spend this time yeah I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone don't make sense to you hmm well that's what we'll do so wait like you do I'll see you again and about a week right right so if you could reflect on some of these changes do you think you can make with this relationship well you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator because a lot of this revolves around communication oh yeah communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating in the arguing so that you have to end to these arguments right it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result yeah yeah that would be cool we can do that okay so if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then the next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes you know in that relationship to to meet those goals right all right suck it all right thanks for coming in con man thank you  ",
  "﻿T:\they hey doing today \nC:\tI guess I'm okay how are you \nT:\tI'm well thanks for asking  soyou say you're doing okay what's going on \nC:\tum just definitely no better than last week when we talked I mean it's been I had some major binges this week I don't even honestly know why we're bothering to talk about it because I've been down this road before mm-hmm I should just I should just like give up and buy some muumuus and you know just resigned myself to the fact that i'm going to get that and i'm going to stay at \nT:\ttell me about some of the foods that you've been eating have been leading to this problem \nC:\tbrownies mm-hmm brownies brownies brownies and well that's what got it started you know I was great the first half of the week and I'm staying away from the sugar away from the flower my son has stayed home from school hurt his head you wanted to bake brownies my son okay let's bake brownies so then we ate the whole pan and we make two more pans and then it didn't just stay the brownies you know went out hamburgers french fries candy you know stopped in wawa the web host its disgusting I can't I don't want to tell you how much because it's just disgusting and clothes aren't fitting it's just really really sad \nT:\tyou've had a rough week \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tso let's talk about for a second I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem how do you view this problem \nC:\tit's disgusting it's like a slave food owns me so the \nT:\tso the food is in control of the situation \nC:\tsounds ridiculous when you say it like that but that's what it is \nT:\tit's in control all right so Nate I won't ask you a couple questions about that the importance and the confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or you wouldn't be here \nC:\toh my god I would love ya \nT:\tso if you are looking at a scale of one to ten one was it's not important to change and ten was it's extremely important change this is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating  * very important to you yeah it's very important okay so what if I asked the same question except this time you're confident so one is you're not confident all you can change but  you're very confident could change\nC:\tI could probably change for half a day mm-hmm I've done it and sometimes if I'm lucky I'll get a week but overall overall it's impossible like you want a number at zero \nT:\tso it's below the blow the scale of one to ten this is yeah so you end of no confidence at all \nC:\tI've tried it I know I mean it's like beating my head against a wall see you \nT:\tso on one hand you'd like to you'd like to stop to eating it's important to you the other hand you don't believe you can do it I\nC:\tcan't you can't do it I can't it can't be done\nT:\thave there been any other changes you have been able to make say in the last few years that have been positive\nC:\tah stop biting my nails\nT:\tso you had some small successes in terms of making changes what do you think makes the this I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful so much more difficult to tackle\nC:\tI wish I knew there's so many things it's it's everywhere the food is a root is everywhere\nT:\the mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week \nC:\tbrownies hershey bars Hershey kisses yeah chocolate \nT:\tyou enjoy chocolate  yeah \nT:\tokay how about other foods it could be contributing the problem that maybe you don't enjoy as much that's chocolate \nC:\tOh potato chips french fries Mexican food what else cheese definitely \nT:\tany of the types of candies\nC:\tstart name and I'm skittles cherry starburst basically any candy \nT:\tpretty much any candy yeah so of of the candy so I want to focus just on the candies and not there the food is just for now the thought of like I introduced the idea is stopping eating chocolate how it's react to that not gonna happen \nC:\tthat's not gonna happen  I would love to write to happen right but that's not I can just tell you I don't even want to pretend so you know that for certain \nT:\thow about the let's let's go for example with the skills what if I've introduced the idea of stopping the consumption of skills\nC:\tjust candy skittles just just that one candy yeah why bother but like I not eat skittles is that what you're saying like \nT:\toh you could it's up to you whether you or not but if i enter just that idea of stopping the consumption of skittles how would you react to that  C\tI don't really understand why \nT:\twell it represents a change in the direction that you want to move \nC:\tbut if I stop eating skittles I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat \nT:\tbut we know we know that's an area that did you know you can't really make a change right now what you're saying like us the idea of stopping chocolate is not going over well with you know it's not gonna happen and that's fine but the idea of stopping skittles that's fine that doesn't seem as daunting no\nT:\twould you agree skittles on save the  scale that it's important to stop skills\nC:\tyeah okay yeah\nT:\thow confident are you you could not even \nC:\tit's kind of funny now you're talking about it I've sort of want skittles more but you know I'd like from now until next week when I come in here hmm i'd say like i'm ninety-nine percent confident i could not eat skittles and it would not be a major problem \nT:\talright so this is a change that you think you could accomplish even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving a larger problem\nC:\twe know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a changes as likely wiska \nC:\tif I don't eat skittles this week or even for the rest of my life is it gonna solve my problem no but will I do it if that's what you want me to do yeah that's fine\nT:\twell I would hope it's something that that you would want to do I mean what I want is one thing what you wants really important here is this something that made our skills part of the problem yeah small yeah right no pun intended right in another small but it's a small part problem but your degree still part about\nC:\tyeah sure so \nT:\tnot a huge change but it's one that we can work on all right I want you to build to you know genuinely buy into the goal I mean if you don't think it's important we can talk about other areas change \nC:\tno I guess I see what you're saying I mean if I'm going to be completely honest with you I well that's when I paying you for right so I don't think it's gonna work I'll just tell you that what \nT:\tyou think you could stop eating skittles but you don't think it's going to solve the larger problem or lead to exactly all right but that's what we have to work with right now because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control yeah yeah so if I are just the idea of stopping brownies no no no sorry isn't that so let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case it's not perfect it's not ideal but it's what you can do fair enough sounds like a plan so so for this week i'll see you again week for this week just just continue eating skills it was skittles all right let's go ahead and let's see let's see how we do with that change does that seem to make sense yeah all right so work with that and I'll see you can we thank you thank you  ",
  "﻿T:\tum I'm gonna do it\nC:\tokay i guess i guess something happened over this past week i I've been looking for a new job since i left my last one and I found I found this really good job on the internet but the problem is that the job is working with kids and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job and it kind of like it made me think is made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considered for a while which is kind of just giving up giving up we'd forget like I've been thinking about it for a while but a guy also kind of think about the way the way we'd really helps me in like if I'm ever feeling like really really anxious about something um I mean we'd kind of as he chill out hub sort of relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet \nT:\tso the marijuana has real value for you but you don't want to see going \nC:\tyeah yeah it does it's a it's like a way to self-medicate in the way and \nT:\tat the same time you would like this job \nC:\tyeah so I could see how this would be a you know pincher \nC:\tright yet I'm just kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot like I definitely I definitely want to get that job but you know if I cut it if I cut out smoking like I don't know what else I would do like if I if I started to have a panic attack or if if I was really like anxious about like anything that I'm worrying about I got all I don't when I did Cubs \nT:\thave you been treated for anxiety before \nC:\tum I I did therapy for a little bit but it was like I don't know back then it was kind of like when anxiety was just starting so it wasn't too big of a problem so I like I click there because it was really doing that much yeah \nT:\tyou take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety \nC:\tI mean like if i'm bored or maybe if i'm like hanging out with buddies like I don't really have a reason not to do it like until now but it wasn't like like I really use it whenever I like feeling really anxious about something \nT:\tso and you may not be able to answer this question but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana\nC:\tif I didn't have like any kind of anxiety um like it would simply kind of tough to give up because like if I'm hanging out my buddies they offer it to me like that's that's all that's pretty chill but um I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job without weighing the benefits of just like smoking smoking my money's so \nT:\tso you're excited with the job \nC:\tI am yeah it's it's almost kind of a dream job\nT:\ttell me about it \nC:\twell it's working with its working with kids with autism and the school so look I would be kind of like a almost like a personal ta in a way so like it's a part of an inclusion program so when the kids are going into the class like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up and it's like since my brother as autism that's like it's that's something that I've always really kind of wanted to work with \nT:\tso sounds like a real passion for this type of work and and really the big obstacle here is this marijuana \nC:\tit is it's like a catch- too because it's like I know the job would be great but it's like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job and it's it's going to be super it's gonna make you super anxious you know it's going to be like it's going to be a lot of anxiety taking a new job so it's like if I have to give up the marijuana and then like not have another way to cope with anxiety like to get the job it's that's a good like a catch- \nT:\tyeah it's a predicament yeah you're kind of weighing both sides of this right now I'm wondering do you have you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana \nC:\tyeah I mean no not really \nT:\tso you're really using it recreationally and as an anti-anxiety agents \nC:\tyeah pretty much \nT:\tso if you were I know you didn't have great success before in therapy we want to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which seems like you would really like do you think you would be able to stay away from marijuana\nC:\tI think if the therapy really worked I would be able to UM like it's just so easy now just to kind of light up like that's an easy fix and like I don't think therapy is gonna be that instead so like you know it it would be tough I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work I could do it but I mean it would have to it would definitely have to work like I just as well as as smoking  you would need to see results  yeah yeah definitely \nT:\twould having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety \nC:\tafter a while like after I got use of the job but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious and then like it would be tough not to not to smoke while doing that like I don't I I don't even get why they drug test anymore because like it's it's been decriminalized being legalized in so many places and there's so much research saying it's not that bad it's kind of like it's really upsetting that the place that I really want to work as that policy I think it's really silly\nT:\tyou're frustrated marijuana is illegal yeah it's yeah at the same time it's the reality you're living it right yeah it's I think it will be legalized and like in the state in a couple years but until the end like I mean I can't wait that long to start start working so \nT:\tuntil then you still need to address this dilemma \nC:\tright yeah these soil problem \nT:\tso you have choices here right you can continue to use marijuana and take the job right and that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages right because you would really like that job\nC:\tyeah and i was it's it sound sympathetic to be like no I don't want to take my dream job because I need weed like such it was stupid \nT:\tso what do you think you are in terms of making this change you feel motivated to take some steps toward it \nC:\tI don't like I'm I'm so kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job I could do that but I would definitely need like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety like whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah i would i would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good\nT:\tso you definitely say you definitely need it so you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety right that's that's key to you to make this change yeah but at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job\nC:\tright yeah I mean I mean if I really thought that I could like it's some kind of treatment that was as good as weed yeah I mean I could i get them maybe quit and especially the house to get this job especially \nT:\tso with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase and then you could take the child that you want yeah yeah I've been notably the best best outcome is that the outcome you would most want\nC:\tyeah i think so i think i could give up wrecker like doing it my buddies recreationally I could yeah I'm just light up a cigarette \nT:\tso here's what I'm thinking and let me know what you think about this when you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety if we start you know I start treating this anxiety you know I see if we can get it reduced and kind of work from there because maybe when you start to feel if that works and that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like it'll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage yeah what kind of time frame are you on terms of taking this job \nC:\tI mean the job it has a high turnover rate so like even if I like I need to apply this week but if I don't get in more likely another position like it will open up like within a month or two \nT:\tand when would they drug test you \nC:\tum it would be like a right after I apply so if I applied and then did the interview that's when they will give him the paperwork and I have to give you a drug test when was the last time you spend more on \nC:\tjust a couple days ago to \nT:\tsee what I'm getting at \nC:\tyeah yeah it's a yeah so I like I wouldn't be able to do I wouldn't be able to make it this application but I would like to be off it by the next one\nT:\tso you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high right because it gives you opportunity to apply later on so do you feel like you could invest in that plan let's work on the anxiety see what happens with marijuana see if we can reduce your usage of it or have you stopped that all together and then kind of move toward this job \nC:\tyeah yeah I could deal with that \nT:\talright so the next time you come in we'll start talking about the anxiety and let's see what we can do about that move from there all right yeah it sounds good that's good thanks Scott thank you  ",
  "﻿T:\tso brings you here today \nC:\twell my doctor made me come said of my diet is bad and my cholesterol level is up so high that I've got to change the way I eat and honestly I don't really feel like doing that so he said I had to come talk to you and hopes that that's going to help\nT:\tok so what's nothing to me is that your doctor saying you have an issue a health issue at your cholesterol and nearly an allison issue of this present time cycle\nC:\tright right it was actually I feel pretty good they do a test on me and says mom not healthy because what I eat them I don't know it doesn't bother me\nT:\tok so you sound a little we're very resistant to change\nC:\tI like french fries I like fast food I don't want of time to cook you know this is the food I eat his burgers it's what's my lifestyle and he says I got to stop eating french fries sometimes pizza I like sausage and a breakfast I eat almost the whole pound of bacon log bacon bacon on my eggs bacon on the sandwiches I like bacon on the cheeseburgers the doctors like mr. Hendricks you have to stop eating bacon wait a minute I don't know about that french fries \nT:\tso this is the first time you went to the doctor he makes an account with your high cholesterol okay so how long \nC:\tit's been going on for a while I mean every time he was like yeah I think you how to change the way ye na ma alright and then I keep eating it the this time he's dropped the heavy on me and he said you're gonna have to do this and he showed me pictures of cholesterol problems and told me facts and stories about people that's didn't stop eating the bad foods and cholesterol levels where they ended up not so I don't want to die \nT:\tokay so what do you thing to do to help resolve the issue \nC:\tI'm kind of hoping some other options i'm changing my food \nT:\thave you considered exercise\nC:\twe didn't talk so much about that he was so focused on the food but I'd be willing to exercise if I can still eat my fries \nT:\tokay will sound like you have it this semester issue the food thing you are not great to give up but exercising to be a possible Avenue just to lower your cholesterol levels ok so how motivated are you today start like a rigorous exercise routine \nC:\tthe lord I kept glycerol was six maybe a seven even okay\nT:\tso what could you do this week to start now once you've in this office today to have lower your cholesterol \nC:\tfollow the hunger but how odd probably willing to talk to somebody about an exercise program \nT:\tokay have you know participant in an exercise program before \nC:\tno\nT:\tokay knows me a lot of work and I respect your decision that you are not ready to give the food but you have a decision to make good choices it is your choice to do with you\nT:\tis it D but this is too much for you like you're incapable of this this is beyond you you can now show your dad \nC:\tI can do it but I don't know if I'd be happy \nT:\tso how would you know if you're not happy until you try it \nC:\tI got a feeling I wouldn't be happy but I'm wrong \nT:\tokay so you say motivated like a  or a  mm is that the highest like today that you've been or wish your motivation\nC:\tI'm lowering operators after my last doctor appointment \nT:\tokay it is promised been going on for how many watts or \nC:\tyeah probably three to four years three or four years okay he's noticed it's been a while since my cholesterol hasn't started to come down \nT:\tokay so this is like neglect for the three or four years pretty much but you are little motivated now \nC:\tyeah he scared me all about with the health reports he was giving me \nT:\tokay when's next time you go to the doctor\nC:\the wants me back in a month \nT:\tokay so cuz you're a little motivated he said I'm six or seven we can maybe establish a pan for you so we listen good a doctor your clothes will be lower than what it was just this present month that'd be good sorry the plan sorry your plan  ",
  "﻿T:\tgood morning Jenny thank you for coming in again how have you been doing since the last time we met \nC:\tdoing good doing good just you know work the kitty stroll last night  tricks um then I saw my man one of these other girls were skimming off the top and he beat her up good and I i just decided come in here cuz you know the money wasn't so good last night but a lot better than working for mcdonalds right \nT:\tyeah so you you saw your without your boyfriend beating up another girl \nC:\tyeah my man was beating up another girl she works for him too okay\nT:\tso what what do you think happened there\nC:\tright she was just stupid she was skimming off the top and you know at least be smart about it charges the john like a couple extra dollars and do it that way but she was like doing it based regular price and she got caught she didn't meet her quota \nT:\tokay so how do you feel about that how how do you feel about he'll be up and in front of you \nC:\toh I mean he gotta do what he gotta do but I it was it was weird because it was right in front of me and these other girls and he beat her up really badly like even more than just like like a couple dollars was worth as if like she been doing it for a long time but I don't think so cuz he would have been in there up Oh like when it started just saw it i mean her face is pretty messed up so she got their ass tonight \nT:\tso it sounds like it affected you to witness stuff \nC:\tyeah yeah i guess so i mean it's it's scary know like your you're just out there and you're working and he's supposed to protect you because I mean we got the dual system kind of like me and this other girl we make sure we check in oh but I mean we can still get attacked by johns and stuff like it's it's like a part of the job I mean we make pretty good money but working on the kitty stroll would word like we have to take care of each other and then he's supposed to take care of us so when he reprimands this is kind of like it's just another thing no it's another like like he could just told her not to do it again but i don't know i mean he's running a business whatever it's his business but it's just scary just just thinking about it like he could have done that to me and maybe i would have even gotten worse \nT:\twow so you afraid that he might do that to you and you you kind of view him viewed him in the past or until last night as a protector so you afraid that he might do that to you also\nC:\tI mean it's not like it's not like I haven't seen him beat up other girls I mean but usually it's not that bad you know it's like host maxim went down poncho anything like that but then he was really beating her up to a point where like like her whole face was swollen purple black I don't know but I mean it's not like she was the first one ever like skim off the top but I guess she got Kai \nT:\tso he's getting out of control he's getting out of control\nC:\tI think so if I mean it never saw him like that before and I mean I don't want to be receiving and you know am I not pretty faith then that mean I can't work\nT:\tso you are afraid for your life you're afraid that he might do it to you sooner than later \nC:\tyeah I'm definitely scared about that happening um I just don't know what to do i mean i can't i can't make the same money on a regular part-time full-time job you know like i can make easily five hundred dollars a night at the control then to be like making nine dollars an hour whatever minimum wage is at i don't know a store doing merchandise or whatever also we selling stuff but i won't be making good enough money \nT:\tok so I'm so what I'm hearing is that you you are starting to be afraid of your man yeah and you are tired of witnessing all this abuse happening and you would like to to try something else maybe work out a store but you're not sure if the money will be enough because you're not used to making you know just minimum wage and you are you're not sure you're not sure if you want to leave that life but you are afraid you're afraid for yourself \nC:\tyeah and I even dropped our high school because you know what am i what am I going to do with books and stuff when I'm making a  night at most unless it was a slow night but soul night or whatever just like what what we need college for what do I need school for I don't need a diploma I mean I mean not even that's mine so why am I going with my time because as time goes on like we grow older we like lose our beauty and everything so I might as well just use whatever I can out fucking school I guess i'll go later whatever else or even need it but i don't i don't want to be like wasting my time I got a job that I'm not gonna like I mean not that like this one but at least it's like let's work for more money ok so\nT:\tit's important to you that you make a certain amount of money to support yourself \nC:\tyeah okay sure I don't want to like have to like worry about Oh am I gonna pay my phone bill or oh I like that purse but I can't afford it I want that i want to make good money now ok but then again like getting her Oh sometimes raped it's just just too much\nT:\tso it's so on one hand it's it's important to you that you have nice things that you make a certain amount of money but then the other you don't want to continue risking your life this ways that that's what I'm hearing that you don't want to continue with this lifestyle you feel like it's getting out of hand as far as the violence \nC:\tI mean this is only like I've been working since I was  so this is only thing that I know I don't know how to do anything else flip burgers whatever you know I I by mcdonalds I don't sell McDonald's \nT:\tok so it's it's it seems like you you would like to do something different but it is a particular type of job you would like to do and the type of money you would like to make \nC:\tand but but I mean what kind of job is that makes us good money there's not that many jobs and not that many jobs I mean right there so it's like like I don't know it's just \nT:\tso you feel like you're not you're not smart enough good enough to try something different \nC:\tyeah I don't feel smart enough to do that to like change like what i've been doing this is all I know so it's it's all I can do I mean I wish I could do something else but what can i do that i mean what's the references i'm gonna do oh I've been doing from this to this you know working the streets no one's gonna hire me no no one's going to give me like a chance no one's gonna go oh she dropped out of high school and and then start working the streets let's give her a job \nT:\tyeah so you would like to try something different you would like to maybe try a different type of work but you're afraid that people will not give you a chance and they will judge you based on on the fact that you dropped out of high school and you've been working the streets and so you're afraid that maybe people will not see that you you are smart and and you want things in life and coming in here and speaking about it is a good thing you know and no and understanding that maybe I can try something different is a good thing you know it's it's it takes courage and and you afraid that people will not see that in you \nC:\tyeah ah I just want them you know what I just want to be able to be doing what I do without fear though cuz i don't mind like I don't care what I do I'm whatever about it I mean this someone has to do it you know if we had like no prostitution I don't think was like I don't think politicians we get their rocks off ah but yeah like I wouldn't mind doing what I'm doing but I don't want like that the things that that happened to girls all the time I don't want to get breathe in I don't want get a choked or whatever okay \nT:\tso you would you would rather a safe place that you don't mind what you're doing but you you you you would like for it to be a little safer for you and \nC:\tyeah but that's that's like that's like utopia want wanting something or whatever that is whatever utopia is it's like peace or something I had wanted John talking about it I was like what no crime so use \nT:\tthese things like you you know you you want you you don't mind the job in one way but you afraid for your life and you also want to try something different like you want to do to show the world that you can you know you can do other things and you you know even though you dropped out of high school you can have another job but at the same time having a certain type of the money making a certain type of money is important to you and having nice things on point \nC:\tI mean I can't go into college without like a GED or anything like that so I don't know I mean cause you spent like is expensive so now we have like a place i'm living at right now i live with my man okay so do some most like the other girls too we can't put like we can't be applying for college applications and then having male go to the house that would be weird i think i think i might get beaten up for that \nT:\tokay so you can't you can't do anything as far as for yourself like you can't apply for school i'm leaving there\nC:\tno no if if he thinks that we're going to be leaving I think I'll get worse than beating up I think might get killed okay\nT:\tso you would write you would you would like to apply for college but you afraid that you might get killed if your man finds out that you are applying for college so it seems like it means something to you that you you continue your education \nC:\tyeah I mean there's only so many options for me to do and that the only option right now seems like I gotta keep working the streets cuz I don't got a house I don't you know have anything that belongs to me like it like per se I mean I guess everything's like all the girls we share like everything all the clothes um yeah we we sometimes sleep in the same room okay but we're in the same house and I don't know like I don't think I can afford moving out by myself okay \nT:\tso one day you would like to move out but you don't think it can work out right now as far as your living situation \nC:\tI mean I don't think I got many options and I don't I don't see the opportunities like around I mean like if you if you think about it I'm I'm stuck maybe if I was like back at  if someone stopped it from happening then maybe I've had a chance but no \nT:\tokay okay so what I'm hearing is that you know you would like to try something different you would wrap you would like to go to college but you are afraid to even apply for to go to college because you don't want your man to find out you know you you feel like you can do something better with your life but the opportunities or not you don't

  "﻿T:\thi John nice to see you again so tell me how are things going \nC:\twell doc I know you told me that I need to lose weight and even though the scale didn't show today I was able to lose about  pounds but then I gained it right back \nT:\twell I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront do you mind if we explore this issue further \nC:\tno by all means I know we have to discuss it all right \nT:\twell it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently and I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have to come back again so tell me what you did to lose that initial  pounds \nC:\tI started watching what I ate I ate less I've been eating more fruits and vegetables I've also been walking I'm walking up to  minutes a day now I saw the way come slowly off and I felt better but then I watched it come back on again I gave up \nT:\tbut you did have some success tell me how you felt when you lost the weight \nC:\tI felt great I felt really proud of myself I thought that this was something that I could do okay\nT:\twell it sounds like you realize that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's going to affect your overall health so tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back well\nC:\tI think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables that's it\nT:\tand how many servings are fruits and vegetables on average per day would you\nC:\thave to be honest I have four five forty six glass of orange juice a day I have fruit for lunch and breakfast I have usually one to two servings of a vegetable my close your broccoli with thinner \nT:\tJohn is very important that you recognize that some fruits but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola \nC:\tno I didn't know umm but doesn't the food pyramid classify fruit juice as a serving \nT:\tyou're absolutely right but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only when it comes to nutrition we have to have a more personalized approach so I have a hunch and that is the excess fruit that you are consuming probably caused your weight rebound what's your impression \nC:\twell this changes quite a bit I mean here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter indeed\nT:\tlet me ask you something knowing what you know now how important is it to to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking \nC:\tit obviously I need to cut back on the fruit juice but boy do I love that OJ oh\nT:\tI understand let me ask you this on a scale from zero to ten zero mean that there's no way you can do it and ten meaning that you're % confidence that you can do it how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking \nC:\tin six or seven \nT:\tall right so you're not a zero so that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable this is something you certainly can do why are you not a zero \nC:\tI guess is because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight\nT:\tso you realize again that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in you're going to decrease your weight you're going to feel better and you're going to impact your health positively \nC:\tyes \nT:\tbut you're also not a ten and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a ten or even an eight or nine \nC:\tgetting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it my wife does the shopping for us so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice that would solve it \nT:\tokay now if the juice was still there can you think of anything else you could do I suppose I could replace it with low-calorie drink or drink more water excellent \nT:\tJohn I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction and the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in so if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're drinking and how you did it what would you tell me \nC:\tI'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with sugar free drinks \nT:\texcellent well it sounds like you have a plan same scale zero to ten how confident are you that you can make this happen okay I agree all right well you know what I'm not going to start any medications today your labs were a little bit off but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint what do you think great sounds good to me excellent I'll see you in two weeks you  ",
  "﻿T:\thi this Bravo I'm hear it and I'm nurse practitioner today how are you doing not that great I could be better Foreman seen here today \nC:\toh I'm just not feeling well I just feel dizzy a lot mm-hmm well\nT:\tI noticed from your previous physical exam couple days ago that your blood pressure seems to be a little bit high it was around  over  and I was wondering how you are managing this blood pressure or are you aware of your hypertension \nC:\tyeah I'm aware that I have hypertension but I don't really measure my blood pressure every day but now that what that you mentioned what my blood pressure is I do have concerns \nT:\tokay well thank you for seeing me today I understand that you have concerns about your blood pressure can you please tell me more about it \nC:\twell to tell you the truth I'm not really taking my water pills every day because it makes me pee a lot and I don't like it and nobody told me about the side effects of this medication that's why I don't like taking it I'm not really sure if it's making my blood pressure better because I don't feel any difference also sometimes I forget to take my medication since I live by myself and nobody is there to remind me I really want to manage my blood pressure I know I can do it but I just need help \nT:\tokay it seems to me that you're really concerned about your blood pressure and that you are willing to change if I'm understanding this correctly you are not aware of any side effects of your medication and your water pill makes you go to the washroom a lot which makes you not want to take your medication even more also you mentioned that you are living alone and so you tend to forget your pills and you would want some help to remember that is this correct \nC:\tyeah that's correct okay\nT:\twell thank you for sharing this information with me and for your honesty since both of us are aware that this is an issue would it be okay to talk about your hypertension and what it means to you yeah okay to start would you mind describing some at disadvantages of your hypertension so that we can see you may have \nC:\twell first of all all I know that hypertension is when you're have a really high blood pressure and it can lead to me suffering a stroke or heart attack and cause that the doctor prescribed me this may six to manage my hypertension but I have no idea how it works and what can be the possible side effects of this medication it's also a challenge to maintain a healthy diet because I live alone and I can't go to go grocery shopping and cook for myself because it's tiring to cook for yourself and i'm already  years old and i'm having difficulty finding motivation to exercise but the most challenging part of having hypertension is not being able to take the medications every day consistently I know what I have to do I just need someone to help you learn how to do it \nT:\tokay well I just shut down some of the concerns that you mentioned just so super clear that we have it here and it seems to me that your biggest concern is your medication adherence and that is pretty much affecting like your daily activities such as going to get exercise or preparing a meal is this right yeah that's right okay now that we've identified some of the challenges we cannot can we please identify some of the advantages of you take your medication properly \nC:\twell the advantage is that this medication can help me manage my blood pressure since you've been formed me that my current blood pressure right now is  over  and I'm aware that that is high and I can still live a normal life such as play with my grandkids and being able to exercise without experiencing any headaches or dizziness I'm able to prevent myself from developing a stroke so basically more chances of me living longer and healthy \nT:\tokay that's awesome um when it comes to the importance of you taking your medication on a scale from  to   being unimportant  the most important how important is it to you for you to take this medication \nC:\twell it's very important to me so it's a  out of  because I really want to manage my blood pressure every day and I want to live a healthier life \nT:\tnow that this issue is very important to you I would like to know how confident you are in achieving this goal so again on a scale from  to   King unconfident and  the most confident how confident are you that you are able to take your medication regularly \nC:\twell I would say about a vibe of  because it's difficult for me to take this medication because of the side effects that I always experience with it\nT:\tok what would it take for you to go from an  or above or even a  out of  for your confidence \nC:\tmay be constant follow up and support support from family regarding managing my hypertension to help me adhere with my medications regularly \nT:\tok thank you for that let me see if I'm understanding this correctly you're aware that you have hypertension and you truly want to manage your blood pressure but you're unable to do so because there are certain challenges that you face such as you can diet for getting your pills regularly not being able to monitor your blood pressure but this leads you to not seeing the full effect of the medication itself however you are so confident that you're able to change by let's say going to a followup with me or having support from your families or friends am I\nC:\tyeah that's right you mentioned all the information I discussed \nT:\tok it seems like you are willing to change your behavior and at the same time you are frustrated about not getting the medication that you need for you to change or support that you need to change am I is a spread\nC:\tyeah that's right it's frustrating not getting enough support but after talking with you I feel more relieved that I can get the support than I need it \nT:\tok do you have any ideas on how to achieve this goal \nC:\tmay be changing the type of medications I'm taking right now because I don't like living with the side effects of it ok and getting more information regarding about the side effects of this lasix and how it's affecting my body and maybe by pill containers to track of my everyday medication so I don't miss any dosage also I should learn how to monitor my blood pressure using the machines to make sure the medication is working well ok and maybe i will go to a clinic near my area to monitor my blood pressure ok\nT:\tum I'm wondering if you are able to or you'll be open to your monitoring your blood pressure for the safe and next couple of months um just monitoring and see if that side effects are there or if it's working for you this way we can evaluate whether the medication is right for you this time this is ok \nC:\tyou know that's fine and I also want to have a personal diary to monitor my blood pressure regularly oh that's what's like a great plan that can actually work \nT:\tif you want I can give you some information about like new medications and if you have any questions don't hesitate to give me a call also for the next appointment that we're going to have if you can bring your your diary where you write your blood pressure down we can see and track down how is the medication is for you is there anything else I can do for you \nC:\tno that's all I feel more relieved now that I talk to you and I'm looking forward to our meeting next week okay well thank you so much for openness and honesty i hope this speaker will be better for you and I will see you in a next appointment  ",

  "﻿T:\tgood afternoon miss fish I would like to personally thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk to us regarding smoking cessation we're basically going to go through a few questions that will help both of us get a better understanding about your current smoking status and I'm going to just take some notes here as we continue to talk okay first of all how long has you have you been smoking and at what age did you begin to \nC:\tthink I was   that's about  years  years okay okay\nT:\tand in those  years had you ever trying to quit \nC:\tyeah I tried once when I was pregnant but it just didn't work okay I know I hear it's not worth even the time to be honest \nT:\tokay well that's fine I mean what you definitely deserve some applause for you know your willingness to quit in it as you know smoking is a very difficult habit to quit especially for a time I paid like  years so what were your reasons behind wanting to quit in those previous tips \nC:\treally is one one main time and is right for it right when I got pregnant the doctor kept nagging me my mom kept nagging me they just kept saying how bad it was for my baby and finally I just got tired of fighting the battle and I quit\nT:\tokay okay then and then what did your physician tell you about more of the specific dangers in continuing to smoke\nC:\the really didn't say anything just that it was bad \nT:\the just said it was bad  okay so if I understand you correctly miss Fisher on you saying that you have been smoking for  years with several attempts to quit in the past but ultimately no long-term success okay both your mother and other family members along with your physician have told you several times on that you need to quit but neither of those individuals everyone into the overall specifics about the actual dangers of wanting to quit smoking is that does that sound about right yeah pretty much okay\nT:\tokay so let's kind of take it one step forward um and those are tips to quit in the past what was it that you know made you start back smoking again \nC:\twell I needed it to get through the day it calms my nerves I crave it I want a few of kids but they're stressful stressful and I just can't make it without one \nT:\tokay okay then well that's that's quite all right in this fish I mean we have we have a multitude of patients that mentioned those particular reasons specifically right there also you know as you know I mean but I would say that we've had also great successes working with those patients and ultimately getting them to quit smoking so there's there isn't any lost hope with that so let's let's move into talking about your reasons for wanting to quit should you should you desire to do so what will be those reasons for wanting to quit if you decide to do so \nC:\tI still think it's a lost cause but I'm not sure I guess something on TV it says it's back to health my doctor said is bad for my health my mom says it's bad for my health so I guess it's bad for my health I've smoked for so long I don't notice anything to me it's what gets me through my day \nT:\tokay then get you through the day okay well well tell me this what was the longest period of time that you were able to quit in the past you know since you mentioned the previous quit attempts\nC:\tguess the pregnancy so about nine months or so I started back pretty much day one after my baby's born\nT:\tokay why are you able to quit for nine months that's it that's it that's a pretty big accomplishment miss Fisher if you think about it that's pretty much close to in close to an entire year you know do you does that make sense that that's a pretty long period of time you know one whole year why don't you \nC:\tdefinitely think about it\nT:\tokay I mean and I can and I believe it's safe to say that was a pretty tough decision considering the fact that you've been smoking for  years right one okay and so basically the fact that you are willing to take it upon yourself in the meantime to quit while you're pregnant that speaks volumes of you you know so that would that would basically lead into my next question you on what would have been the worst thing that could have happened to you if you had quit me smoke if you have started to quit smoking for good after your pregnancy \nC:\tyes there's nothing bad\nT:\tnothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important \nC:\tfive okay well well\nT:\twhy a five and not a three or four \nC:\tI guess you pointed out I did it for nine months cold turkey so maybe I could do it again for longer in this time for my health they're not for my babies okay\nT:\talright that's it and that's a great point that you bring out to me miss Fisher on I believe this gives us some some great foundation you know should we decide to move forward with this to with the smoking cessation if it's okay with you I would really like to schedule another interview with you or another point we can actually sit down and go into further detail about about these other barriers that people face on there when they're smoking and also share with you some of the great benefits that that can come of quitting smoking on would that be something that you would be interested in yeah okay well that would be great I mean I would like to thank you again for coming by and we can schedule you an appointment for advocate I was saying about one week does that work for you yeah time free okay and in the meantime I like to come and hand you this tobacco log right here this isn't it this isn't an attempt to help you quit rather it would help us identify some specific triggers and identify triggers that you may face along the road to quitting smoking okay well thank you very much and you have a good rest of the day okay nice meeting  ",
  "﻿T:\tso now I want to talk to you a little bit about some of those answers I said we would get back to okay so firstly I just want to just summarize kind of way you said that you've tried smoking cigarettes one time didn't like it you've had a few drinks a few different times over the last year at some parties and you also got a ride from someone who you knew was smoking marijuana did I get all those ready right yeah okay all right so I want to say that you know it's a good thing that you seem to not like smoking seem to have decided that you don't want to smoke I hope you would continue to you know to decide that you don't want to smoke it's also really good that you don't use anyone else's prescription medicines I know it's really tempting in high school with your busy schedule and you know just trying to use things to help you study to help keep up with your busy schedule so it's really a good thing that you that you've also avoided doing that but it really it is concerning about your drinking so i just wanted to hear a little bit more about that from you so could you just tell me a little bit about your drinking\nC:\twell it's not really that big of a deal it's just on the weekends i have a couple of beers and i think the main thing was the homecoming when I just got a little scared because I didn't remember parts of that night so and like my friend they threw up so it was kind of scary\nT:\tokay so just to clarify so it sounds like when the one hand you know you kind of drink to fit in at your friends I'll do it that you felt kind of would help feel a little bit more comfortable in this date but on the other hand just being afraid of some of the consequences and seeing friends get sick or kind of a negative for that well well I am concerned about your drinking you know just so you know we used to think that people's brains were done developing by the time you were  but now we know that they develop well into your s and alcohol really can have an effect on developing brain cells probably that time where you didn't remember everything you did that night we call that a blackout and that's usually an indication that there's some subtle effects of the alcohol in your brain cells so so again that that's concerning not to mention that often people do things that they later regret when they're drinking so so just to think about all that and really I would recommend that you not drink at all until you turn  okay so I mean just to think about that but if I had to have you put on a scale of  to   being not at all interested  being very interested where do you think you'd be as far as your interest in stopping drinking right now \nC:\tthat sounds like a good idea probably like nine or  \nT:\tokay good so now I just want to talk also about driving with the friend who was smoking marijuana yeah I mean just to make sure you understand it a lot of times people may seem fine but really they're not especially with the the skills you need to drive safely so so that's something that you one to avoid here \nC:\tI'll just call my parents next time I need a run \nT:\tokay yeah i think you know I've known your parents for a long time and I think they'd be understanding and willing to do what they need to do to come get you so good okay what do you have any questions no I think that's good okay so what I want to do is have you come back in a couple months and just check in to see how you're doing with with not drinking so let's see how that goes and you'll come back in a couple months and we'll we'll see how that way okay so good  ",
  "﻿T:\tso I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself \nC:\tsure um as you know i'm andrea i am a junior i'm in the marching band i plated center sacks honey yeah i'm also in the little bit of a band geek i play you know the wind ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that \nT:\twow you really are involved in music yeah when did you start \nC:\tI started playing about  years ago actually Wow yeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah\nT:\tvery cool I've always wanted to be good at music it all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun \nC:\tum you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that it's kind of everyday sort of day okay \nT:\ttell me a little bit about your family  uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog \nT:\tcute what kind of dogs the golden retriever oh nice okay big boy very fun \nT:\talright and how are things going in school for you \nC:\tI'm pretty good grades have been pretty alright I still like three point seven ish okay\nT:\tgreat so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school \nC:\tI'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come at psychiatrist or something okay you\nT:\thave some pretty big dreams yeah it's great that's really exciting to think about that and you're going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life\nC:\tum I think a sense of community and belonging okay I think those two and um respect \nT:\trespect okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three \nC:\tyeah well I think community and belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching men I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal mm-hmm and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so okay I place great importance in that\nT:\tokay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose in the way and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing and not just authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends \nC:\tum sometimes you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out mm-hmm and\nT:\twhen you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved \nC:\tyeah sometimes \nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and getting loosened up as they say mm-hmm and\nT:\tso when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking \nC:\tI'd say um on a not busy month for instance i'd say about like two weekends out of the month to three\nT:\tmm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink \nC:\tthe days that we drink or mostly like I said their parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching the movie it's not yeah so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get down there \nT:\tokay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games \nC:\tI think of them as as different i think you know night in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining mm-hmm but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have\nT:\tokay so there's sort of pros and cons em yes okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol \nC:\tum it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad\nT:\tokay so sort of in the the too much drinking or times can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol \nC:\tum a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that way we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleep over a friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid \nT:\thmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some something's happening yeah can you tell me a little bit about that\nC:\twell I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we ended up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun \nT:\tyeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened \nC:\tfor me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do some time so I'll end up like having to take care of them banging okay it kind of put it down around my my fun \nT:\tuh-huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol our people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much ok any other not so good things about the alcohol \nC:\tyeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff \nT:\tso you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean this video yeah got it ok all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions \nC:\tI just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or something a parent at home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be with a half one \nT:\tok yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect to so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then it sort of defeats the purpose and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of glass lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that \nC:\tin terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because i'm not putting things i'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of how ways i am respecting myself i am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met mm-hmm into I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that\nT:\tokay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but without crossover okay and what have you come up with at this point you have sort of a limit that you stick to or I\nC:\tusually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in a and how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you don't get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and i'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cousin so people aren't gonna be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and i'll so be you know having some to like let loose a little mm-hmm okay and\nT:\tdo you feel that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think \nC:\tfor the most part it works pretty well because like i said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have some like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into okay too much \nT:\tso a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like I'd like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself \nC:\tum I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less okay like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like  mm-hmm and you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community\nT:\tuh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing\nC:\tright now I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't uh-huh well\nT:\twhy did you say six or seven rather than like a four um because I still think it's it's important \nC:\tuh-huh I still you know like I said I don't want my body try especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social on your schoolwork and things like that i know that once i get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam like I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea\nT:\tyeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to I think on that same scale from one to ten \nC:\tI think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a tent I know I \nT:\toh wow okay why did you say  it's just because i know that once i make the decision I know I can do it making the decision in the first place okay weather \nT:\tokay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that \nC:\tum I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking I mean not drinking and then doing whatever they want \nT:\tso sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than your drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or \nC:\tI think so i think it's it's very feasible i think it's possible okay \nT:\tso I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going I think so that's good does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down an alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health your school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going like all right great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks hurted thanks   ",
  "﻿T:\tfor coming in um so I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here if it's okay I'll give you a little rundown so basically we're here I'm just going to talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in it's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you you know basically I'm going to talk to you about how things are going any changes you might want to make in your life how I could help you with that and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you that's not okay all right so I guess just to get started can you tell me a little bit about yourself\nC:\twell my name is Laura I'm  years old and I'm a senior in high school \nT:\tokay and what kinds of things do a plan for your life \nC:\twell hopefully go to college get you know get enough grades to go to college that's great do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or um I'm not sure yet might be a few schools in the area I'm looking maybe to apply out of state oh alright being away for college cool \nT:\tyeah so kind of keeping your options open yeah definitely great and you have an idea about what you might want to study or yeah maybe I'm pre-law oh wow okay that's exciting \nT:\tyeah all right cool um what do you like to do for fun \nC:\twell um on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends maybe go like a party or go to the mall to shop or if there's like a school related event we'll go to like a football game or something like that yeah I like to have a good time \nT:\tyeah and you have a lot of friends or a few close people or \nC:\tum I would say like a moderate amount I'm not really really popular or like I have no friends um I'm like normal alright that's a good way to be right yeah alright \nT:\tso um it sounds like in general your things are going pretty well for you how are your grades right now um they're pretty good a zombie's so \nC:\tI'm doing okay okay\nT:\twell one thing I want to ask about is you know different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them they might you know be really close with family or really have you know their friends as being something particularly important I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look more so there's things like belonging community cultural identity family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality which of those do you think is sort of important to you \nC:\tum family definitely a friendship and belonging \nT:\tokay what's important to you about your family \nC:\twell I I love them so I want them to think well of me and I want them to be accepting and love me okay and you have brothers or sisters yeah I have one sister okay great and how about friendship \nC:\tfriendship I've grown close to many people that I care about so I would like them to be accepting of me as well great so being a good friend and having people who are good friends too is important and then what about belonging you mentioned that one - \nC:\tyeah just a sense of like fitting in and like being accepted you know yeah not \nT:\twanting to be part of a group yeah kind of okay great all right well one of the things I want to talk about is you know you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of a thing and I'm curious when you're at the parties do you ever have any alcohol \nC:\tum not much maybe like one or two drinks at the most \nT:\tokay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene \nC:\tum I pretty much just have a drink just just have it like so it looks like I'm drinking even though I'm not so maybe people bug me about drinking or something \nT:\tokay you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink \nC:\thave one they're pretending you have it okay and do you think that this is most weekends or occasionally\nT:\thow often do you think that you are one or two weekends of the most very much so\nT:\tone or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol yeah okay and what sort of situations are you in \nC:\twell just I guess at a party or something someone's house uh-huh or even if it's not a party like a small social gathering maybe there'll be like a few beers around mm-hmm so mainly just kind of hanging out with friends pretty much\nT:\tyeah are you ever places where there are parents around or are mostly just just with the kids \nC:\tmostly just with us but sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to her family as well so well I'll just hang out \nT:\tand what about driving \nC:\tum like drunk driving \nT:\tyeah do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol definitely no I've never drunk driven and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver \nT:\tso that's something that you've sort of made a decision about that sounds I know that's extremely dangerous okay what do you know about how that's dangerous\nC:\tum well alcohol definitely impairs your judgment so I mean driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that so I'd rather not be in that situation so\nT:\tyou're really trying to be safe and and make sure that you're not putting yourself in those situations that's great you know it's it's tough to do sometimes and I really commend you for being able to to stick with that yeah so you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two what do you thinks the most alcohol you've ever had in in one day \nC:\tno more than two drinks okay so the the absolute most yeah those two okay and \nT:\twhat kinds of things do you like about alcohol um\nC:\tI've never really been drunk so I can't really say that I like that being or not but it's just I I mean you're just in a good mood \nT:\tmm-hmm so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed yeah okay relax okay anything else \nC:\tum no not really like I said I don't drink that much so I I wouldn't be able to tell you okay and\nT:\tany not-so-good things about alcohol \nC:\tum definitely yeah I mean what about parties is stuff and it's getting a little late some people that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or they're really loud and obnoxious and that's not fun for anybody\nT:\tso you've seen a lot of other kids you had some consequences and decided that's not for you yeah \nT:\tgot it I can understand that any other things that you can think of \nC:\tum no I mean I've never you know been friends with anybody that's got into like a serious accident and stuff it's just very like obnoxious thing \nT:\tokay well so you know as someone who's not  yet it is underage drinking is something that's not legal and it is something that is considered pretty risky so I'm wondering what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life \nC:\tum I know it's definitely risky but I mean I guess we still do it uh-huh\nT:\tso it's kind of something that here it's just there it's just there okay and I'm curious you mentioned you know your friends are important to you and your family's important to you sort of fitting in as important to you and how does alcohol play a role with that \nC:\tum well definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone okay alcohol use but friendships I mean when I'm hanging out with my friends that were at a party or something there's usually alcohol involved okay \nT:\tso from your family perspective the drinking is not something that fits very well yeah and with friends you feel like it's easier to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much \nC:\tI guess I mean this is just there okay so it ties in with the whole blogging okay\nT:\twell when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward and five years or ten years how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life \nC:\tum it probably will have a very small role if any mm-hmm in my life considering I have big plans for my future okay\nT:\tcan you expand on that a little bit more what do you mean \nC:\tI mean I don't think I would be you know drinking as much your going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get it off things like that okay \nT:\tso the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals yeah definitely so when you're sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college \nC:\tum maybe less than I am now I mean I don't drink much anyway so maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon okay \nT:\tso you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually how might that go \nC:\twell I mean I guess right now I would try to stop in highschool and once I get older maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything bigger \nT:\tyeah you don't feel the need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make some adjustments that doesn't get ya that's a good word okay how important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important not something you're thinking about and ten is the most important thing \nC:\tmaybe of five or six and \nT:\twhy did you say five or six rather than like two or three \nC:\tbecause um it's not something I do not care about at all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself okay so it is something you have thought about yeah \nT:\tyeah okay and how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale \nC:\tum I'm pretty confident but I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user say I'm not really into that whole scene so it's not going to be difficult for me \nT:\tso what number do you think you'd say um on the scale \nC:\tone through ten favorite quit or not yeah maybe like an eight or nine okay and\nT:\twhy'd you say eight or nine rather than even like five or six \nC:\tbecause like I said it's not a big part of my life so it's not really types of people okay all right well kind of keeping that in mind\nT:\tit sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point yes and it's moderately important to you it's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it what sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today \nC:\tum probably to stop maybe next party I go to not have a drink at all okay \nT:\tdo you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely \nC:\tyeah I mean I can just tell my friends my parent my friends aren't really that pressuring it's just like outside people that I don't really know that well oh so I could just tell them hey I don't feel like having a drink today \nT:\twhat might be some benefits of falling through with that goal \nC:\tum definitely I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on uh-huh anything else um health concerns I guess I know alcohol is bad for your health and so that would be one okay so\nT:\tit's it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking any more at least at the next party and seeing how it goes yeah okay do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if it's working out for you yeah that would be okay alright great and then \nT:\tit sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do right okay well very good is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know\nC:\tum how would you advise me till I get maybe my friends to stop drinking oh\nT:\tthat's a great question so a lot of times kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol but of course that's harder if you're not the one planning so some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say and there's already alcohol there and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are you know carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just having the coke say without any all mixed into it often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something in it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there do you think any of those things might work for you \nC:\tyeah for sure\nT:\tokay what about in terms of talking to your friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan too I need to stop drinking I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore that wasn't me uh-huh no your friends would be pretty comfortable with that yeah I mean now it's my closest friends for sure okay great any other concerns or questions anything else I go but no I think I'm okay okay so then like I said I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going and then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together okay great that's sound okay yeah all  ",
  "﻿T:\twanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party we're at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life \nC:\tI mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer out I'll take sips every now and then but it's not something that I feel hovers around my life  \nT:\tit's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority yeah how much do you think you're drinking \nC:\tI guess I would say like every other every other weekend maybe a breathe every two weeks on occasion maybe if there's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys but other than that I don't really see it as much of a of a problem  \nT:\tso you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend yeah I guess you can say that well how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't \nC:\tum when I'm not drinking I'm usually more like involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more school work whenever I have the time or whatever I like I can go work out or something just like when whenever I'm drinking I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends  \nT:\tokay so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well \nC:\tyeah I mean I whenever I'm drinking I know that I'm devoting time to to not doing other things so I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work so I try and like get work done before but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity so I'd try and minimize that as much as possible  \nT:\tyou're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done yeah knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder yeah and it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink \nC:\tyeah I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit but just because like when I'm drinking I'm I'm not really focused on what I have to do I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time and it's really something that I just it's something of an like a pleasure giver so I can enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing  \nT:\twhat are the things you enjoy about the drinking \nC:\tjust the way that it it's sort of like liberates you it makes you it makes you feel like a more confident more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself and it's something that you it it's just empowering to a degree  \nT:\tokay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways yeah yeah  \nT:\tokay are there any not-so-good things about drinking \nC:\tum whenever I drink too much I sort of lose control of myself and I I had just a like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever I my friends mix drinks and it just has a harmful effect in my body and that's probably one of the major drawbacks that I have from drinking  \nT:\twhat kinds of things happen \nC:\tI mainly when when I puke or it's just the feeling that I get in my stomach if I drink too much it's just very over like you notice in your body doing  \nT:\thow much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time \nC:\tWow i would say probably at a friend one of my friends had a birthday party recently and he wanted to let loose it was it was just a all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and i just i losted I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way I got to a point where I lost count  \nT:\tthat was out of the ordinary for you don't just count what's a more typical amount that you drink \nC:\tum I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night just because I know I'm I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit but I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go and I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire but I chi I want to see how far I can go just so I know not to go that far  \nT:\tgot it so you're you're sort of testing and pushing it and yeah and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned yeah\nC:\tjust so I know how it feels now so that later on when this the situation is more drastic and more out of control I know what I can do or where my limit is that \nT:\tokay what kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as a goal for yourself in terms of career wise in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years and I would love to be I would\nC:\tlove to travel I would love to see the world for what it is and I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is but I've never really experienced that like I've always wanted to travel to Europe or China or something or some place like that so I can really experience the the world that we live in  \nT:\tso getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life we talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways \nC:\thow do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to its fullest  I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest but I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because I know I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly every single day I don't want to ever get to that point  \nT:\tokay so just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're you're drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and it and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less yeah I feel more in control mm-hmm and then kind of looking ahead you you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control what they're drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to it all and and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with so where do you think you want to go from here with your with regard to your drinking \nC:\tum maybe now that I know my limits to an extent I kind of don't want to push it so so much I now that I know what I can do and where I can go I would like to mitigate that as much as possible i just wanna I wanna have fun being me but I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol so much like I want to live the dis over life to an extent but I know that alcohol it's just gonna tamper with it  \nT:\tso for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking \nC:\tyeah or like not like not drinking like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around like I don't want to have it like in my fridge if my parents have it I don't want I don't want to have to deal with it  \nT:\tokay what do you see as some benefits to that benefits intelligence is sticking to those limits \nC:\tI guess I could definitely be I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like I could possibly be more productive more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life and I think that by not drinking I it will definitely have a better effect on my life \nT:\tyeah I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea you know I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest pleasure you know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months just kind of check in how things are going right all right sounds good thank you very much  \n",

  "﻿T:\tHi thank you for coming \nC:\tokay well I'm not quite sure what to do with this you know just let me tell you that I was I was pulled over for weeding and so they told me that my license was gonna be suspended and when I came here they told me that I had to get an evaluation when I came here the woman out at the front desk said just that I had to take a test before I came to you so I took this I guess it's you know a few questions about about my drinking and but I you know I just want to explain that I was seeing my son in Buffalo and I had probably you know three three margaritas and then they you know I got on the road and was driving back to Erie and they pulled me over and told me I was weeding so they said then I have to do this so I guess I should just get you \nT:\tI'll take this thank you talking I want to thank you for filling you know how did you find the actual checkup itself\nC:\twell I don't know it's you know I mean it's asking me about drinking I haven't thought about a lot of these questions before okay um I see Chris of course he \nT:\twas X go over together sure what asked for this checkup it looks like you scored a thirteen okay which is about a medium so friend dividuals that score  but this is indicating is that year at least at risk for developing some alcohol-related problems and that you may start to experience some difficulties as as it's related to that what do you think\nC:\twell I hadn't thought I had any alcohol problems but I guess this test is indicating that I will or do and I'd certainly open to hear any more \nT:\tyeah it was definitely kidding you're at risk for developing some popular related issues and now okay and it sounds to me from reading this should I say it looks like we might be able to do some things that occurred that listen to some of these examples \nC:\tokay \nT:\tand I see here that for the third question it says how often do you have four more drinks on one occasion you put monthly could you tell me about this for more drinks on one occasion well you know occasionally you know I usually have a couple glasses of wine with dinner and occasionally I'll just you know then have a couple margaritas after that so I would say that happens about once a month maybe your holidays  \nT:\tso more towards holidays you're more likely that for money for drink some more yeah and what have you ever thought of that to be I have something that's unusual or is it something tradition you always had \nC:\twell I think I've been drinking more than I used to I certainly didn't use that two glasses of wine at every meal \nT:\tso lately it's been more frequent yeah okay\nC:\twould you be able to tell me what what if there's infection happening more frequent and excuse me piping lately that's contributed said printing a little more people\nC:\twell I'm alone more I mean my son he's just he's in Buffalo and now he's just going to college and I guess I'm feeling more like a more time instead of everything fix things for him I do what I need to do \nT:\t okay I see here also that question was how often during the last year have you had feelings of guilt or remorse Tony drinking you put less than a month left about that \nC:\twell I you know I think alcohol is expensive and like I go through tequila fairly much more quickly than I used to and so you know occasionally I'll get guilty about that like I could be spending the money on painting the door \nT:\twhat I'm hearing is it sounds like you might feel like maybe who's managing money to a degree the last yeah any other feelings of guilt or remorse surrounding it aside from the financial aspect \nC:\tno no not so much guilt or remorse I think I feel sad and this time \nT:\tI think you have a close relation are you in contact with him often \nC:\twell he's studying you know so well not so much \nT:\tokay I also like to look at number eight and the question was how often during the last year have you been able to remember what happened the night before because you have interacted here you felt less than a month so about it doesn't seem that it's that it's that frequent but there have been times we haven't remember what's happening that there's anything \nC:\twell you know I'll watch shows when I'm on my celebration days month on month on and watch shows and a lot of times I'll try to tell somebody what happened in the show and I can't remember so that's what it is  \nT:\tokay had there been are there other instances in which maybe you couldn't remember certain facts about the day that you contributed  to drinking \nC:\twell I don't know whether I attribute those to drinking or not but certainly my numbers not as good as it was\nT:\tthat makes sense I may be too also number  Alaska let's review it says has a relative or friend or a doctor or other health care worker and concerned about your drinking or suggested you clip down and you put yester in the last year \nC:\twell my son even though if he's fixing margaritas he will tell me that I shouldn't be drinking down there zone before I get on the road so that's the relative that's expressed some concern \nT:\thave you guys had this conversation often\nC:\tno I I mean I go and see him maybe once every three months so I he knows I like margaritas so they'll fix me margaritas but you know usually be before I leave and he usually expresses concern so probably about once every three months \nT:\thow far is the district from where you live to where his colleges about two hours about two hours so you guys get together spend some quality time and then towards the ending of your state you'll have a drink or a fixture margarita and then you'll get on the road yeah and um that sounds like the scenario they probably have lets you being pulled over \nT:\tyeah I'm wondering if if in lieu of what's happening in kind of in lieu of what this assessment has highlighted what do you think about the connection this window with that particular activity and the drug in home \nC:\twell I think it's a wake-up call that I shouldn't be combining the two as much as I am so I know they're going to ask me to do some things for as treatment goes through to get my license back so I imagine that you have a program here that I can sign off for or something \nT:\twe do have some services you can't stand up before and what I'm hearing is something maybe open to something like that sure which I think it is really important for our success together \nC:\twell that's embarrassing and I hate telling people that I was pulled over for weeding \nT:\tyou know these things happen and I think it's very important that you're here and that you're speaking to me about this particular issue and I think it's even more important that you're going to do something about it and I think she got to text me success okay wonderful it's great to hear that thanks thanks so much to doing this was absolutely like you understood that explain this I'm totally open because this has never happened  \n",
  "﻿T:\tMorning stops For morning money so still a game with the psychiatrist working in the drug alcohol service \nC:\tOK \nT:\tI understand that he wants to talk but some of the difficulties that you've been experiencing lately.  \nC:\tWell it was a really good idea.  Friend of mine when he says he you want to be coming.   \nT:\tTell me about what your Branda is concerned \nC:\tshe thinks I'm drinking too much and.  I don't I don't think so but she said if I did I mean that we're going to reconsider the relationship OK \nT:\t I appreciate you taking a big step and coming here to see me today I'm sure your relationship means a lot to you and you definitely want to sort things out with your partner I do you know can you can you tell me a bit more about what Brenda's concerned and how you see the situation \nC:\twell she says I'm drinking too much.  I don't I don't think I have to have a couple drinks with friends you know after work OK You know  \nT:\twhat do you work as \nC:\tI'm a builder \nT:\tOK and how long have you been.  Employed as a builder full.  \nC:\tTen years \nT:\tOK but you self-employed or you might in other cases you're in your business How's that going \nC: \tFine, I'm doing ok\nT:\tSo just a focusing and you know when you're drinking is it alright if I call you by your first name Greg that's for you \nC:\tThat's fine \nT:\tSo Greg, just focus on your drinking, can you tell me a bit about when you first started drinking when \nC:\tI was that sixteen and you know \nT:\tand what would you start thinking of doing.  And how's how's that progress to over time dark\nC:\twill I do wisky I'm off the beer \nT:\tIs it your drink of choice now \nC:\tyes diners and home  \nT:\tOK so if we focused over the last month What's your what would be your average intake over the over weeks \nC:\tare so couple of they were friends.  Sometimes more maybe seven or eight of Jack Daniels of whiskey OK and you whiskey with coke with coke  \nT:\tOK So about five Do you drink in a regular basis every day year after year without ever be a little bit more saying seven eight nine ten.  \nC:\tDepends on the night what's happening with the boys yeah can't can get that much \nT:\tOK what would be the maximum you could you would drink in a day.  \nC:\tProbably ten you know what.   \nT;\tDo you ever crave for a drink.  \nC:\tYeah after work I'm usually looking forward to one of them and when you just are drinking  \nT:\tcan you stop wondering if you have to.  \nC:\tIt's hard to you know when you're out with friends yeah you're instantly problem probably not but doesn't come out and then we found that \nT:\t you did mention that when you were sixteen you started drinking and over the years I mean you've moved from being two to whiskey now but have you found that over the years your alcohol intake has increased.  \nC:\tSure sure a little bit  \nT:\tand do you feel in the same orderings to get the same effect as you used in the past same buzz.  \nC:\tThat.  getting older you know now what about when you  \nT:\twhen was your last period of abstinence when you do not drink it all.  \nC:\tBefore I started drinking  \nT:\tOK So you've been a fairly regular drinker over the last.  Several years here OK.  Have you ever experienced withdrawals when you've stopped drinking we experienced severe shakes use weightier trembling hearts beating really fast.  \nC:\tThere's been occasions couple \nT:\tOK couple of occasions \nC:\tOK.   \nT:\tBrant is obviously concerned about you drinking has a drinking ever got mean gotten into trouble with with the police \nC:\tI've been having rest once for drink driving and.  There's been a few fights in the pub of him nothing nothing too big involving the police or anything to break my hand once  T;\toh have you ever seriously injured your head in the fight like this or.  \nC:\tI I did have a fractured cheekbone when I broke my hand yeah.  I came out of that oh yeah  \nT:\twhat about serious head injury where you lost consciousness and then.   \nC:\tno\nT:\tOK Do you have you ever had blackouts we don't remember we don't the previous day \nC:\tno no \nT:\tso you didn't talk but you did mention the drink driving trouble with the police because of that and you were at home the relationship with brained How's that been affected as \nC:\twell when I have been drinking we are you or she said I get aggressive you know.   And around the king you know.  We argue about the drinking Sure  T;\tdoes that ever get physical  No no I mean ever see you know hey Tiger is a result of \nC:\tnever never done that.  We've got it all covered yelling contests Yeah but it's never progress to No  \nT:\tOK All right so just summarising you if you started drinking when you were sixteen you move from beer to whiskey now and now he drinking and in a fairly regular basis you do crave for it after after work.  And you sort of require a bit more to get the same buzz as well.  Yeah yeah have you ever tried stopping yourself in the past.  \nC:\tNo No No OK All right.  \nT:\t Over the last say month or so how would you describe the mood mood for Young.  And the felt unusually low depressed in yourself you know are you able to enjoy time with your friends and work yeah yeah yeah OK your energy levels keeping up with work on your sleep What's that been like.  \nC:\tSleep is alright I don't know if I do need.  To drink before I go to sleep just because of work yet.  Other than that so OK And  \nT:\thave you ever had any strange experiences at all.  Like hearing voices when you're in the wrong.  Doing paranoid know people trying to harm you conspire against you in any way you know what about anxiety feelings of nervousness.  Worrying about simple things that you shouldn't be worrying about \nC:\tnot not in general no no panic attacks no no \nT:\tOK we've talked about the alcohol do you use any other drugs besides our whole you know like cannabis cocaine and veterinarians in.  Have you ever used them in the past.  \nC:\tBy back in school I did have the drug the the or the or the pill Yeah but.  Once or twice it's one of them really being that stuff \nT:\tOK Have you ever had it on a regular basis not at all no OK almost.  Just moving on from there  You said that you have your own business and you work as a builder is that correct Have you ever been to work under the influence of alcohol no no I'm not about that OK Do you.  Drink Fest in the morning no different than any financial difficulties that you're experiencing because of the all knowing.  \nC:\tI can afford it all right. \nT:\tHow do you see your of your alcohol use of this point in time.  \nC:\tOf I feel it is fairly more or.  The word of the fighting the getting brand of is that she doesn't like it you see the problem so.  You might have to look at that mission OK well.   \nT:\tTell me tell me what you think of the other good things about drinking what does drinking do for you \nC:\thelps me relax after work.  Hanging out of the boys.  Yeah I have a voice being pretty shy I as a person is a troll.  So I do need you know that confidence  T:\tOK So correct me if I'm wrong it gives you confidence because you generally are a shy person it helps you relax after work yes but we've spoken about the good things if I have to ask you  what is the less good things about drinking what would that be.  \nC:\tWell this.  Is the drink driving charge.  The obviously the fighting Brenda.  Get pretty.  Scared of me sometimes.  The thoughts of the partner when I broke my hand had to take a couple weeks off work which was expensive you know.  Parents said that I'm looking less healthy.   \nT:\tYou mentioned that parents of.  The talked about you looking at a little bit less healthy.  Do you have any medical problems at all or diabetes high blood pressure.  And can.  That ever have faints or seizures as a result of not having or call having alcohol.  \nC:\tNo not that I have a ripple or like \nT:L\tso just to summarize the less good things that you mentioned you talked about your relationship your family's really really concerned.  The drinking driving charge as the five as yet where you ended up hurting yourself quite seriously.  And then the other there's good things you can think of\nC:\tnot felt great in the morning after a big one so the one where the hang over is you know.  \nT:\t We've looked at the positives the drinking the negatives the drinking What foods do you have now.  More.  \nC:\tI guess a there are more negative.  And who are.  Specially Brenda in the fight in the ultimatums.  she may have a point.   T;\tBut what concerns you the most about about Currently if we look at your drinking what concerns you the most \nC:\tlosing Branda you know.   \nT:\tWhat what do you think.  Of the advantages of you actually stopping or cutting down the drinking buddy thing might be the advantages.  \nC:\tTo.  Improve relationship.  Health health benefit is yeah.  I guess I'd be saving some money yeah yeah.  Yeah.  \nT:\t I mean all those things that encourage you to make a change or yeah there would be made.  Do you feel that I mean what other any other things that would encourage you to actually make that change.  I don't think I'm getting around well the fact that you're here in the case that it is a part of you sort of wants to wants to maybe make a change or look at it seriously and would I be right in saying oh.  Yeah yeah OK.  Well what do you think might be the practical things that would help you make that change if you did decide to make that.  I'm not sure I'm over well that's something we can definitely talk about further you know we can always come up if you do decide to cut down drinking and look at it seriously then can talk about different strategies to do that.  Do you do you have any fears about making that change you know stopping drinking because I understand it is a big part of your life do you have any fears about stopping it.  \nC:\tOr the maybe hard to hang out with the boys.  And not have a drink.  That's about it.  So do you say it is a problem no drinking or great  \nT:\tI think there are a number of things that we need to consider Firstly the the amount you drinking which is approximately as you said you know looking at five drinks an average per day is definitely above the recommended guidelines for safe drinking.  In definitely no strain and also in the United Kingdom soup the normal recommended guidelines would be about two stand drinks per day so obviously as you're exceeding it it's definitely above the safe limits of drinking but in addition you've also got certain characteristics that fulfill a quite serious for what we would call alcohol dependence OK Now what that means is your alcohol use a sort of.  Escalated to a level where you where your body's gotten very very used to it so you're craving for a drink you find difficult stopping in one your bodies requiring more alcohol to get the same effect OK at the same time it's affecting several aspects of your life it's affecting your relationship.  You know social life in the sense that you know you've gotten into trouble with the police you've gotten into fights you know sometimes things can have disastrous consequences with the fight except for your family members a big concern and the concern that this is If things progress you know the amount that you will need will recall will because of the tolerance that alcohol can induce in the body because the body gets used to the amount of drinking that one more and more over time to get the same effect as a result of that it can have both psychological and physical consequences on the physical consequences can be it can affect your liver to a great extent it can affect your brain again just in if in the extent and also of course psychological consequences can cause depression anxiety so there are several things that we need to look at and that this level of drinking it definitely I would consider it problematic so it's something that we can look out.  And and talk about further.  OK but I appreciate that again I say that you've taken and it's a very very big step that you've taken to come in here in and talk to me to there.  And you do seem like you you want to make.  A difference to your relationship.  What I like to do is to give you some information to take on \nC:\tOK OK\nT:\t about alcohol in the harmful effects of alcohol and one's life one's health because it tends to affect several domains of one's life you know financial social occupational health of the psychological and physical health other family members.  Is all those to the several things that Uncle can affect the like you have a read of it and what we can do is we can have a meeting with yourself and Brenda next time and we can look at it for them does that seem reasonable a sense of oh well thanks for coming in today I'll give you some information take a little catch up in two weeks thank you. \n",
  "﻿T:\thi my name is Ashley and I'm with counseling services here at UT um let's start by having you tell me a little bit about yourself and what brings you in to see me today \nC:\tmaybe you can tell me okay here goes my name is Hillary and I'm a freshman here at UT my parents live in Ohio that's where i'm from originally cleveland ohio i'm here at UT for the veteran a program i heard was pretty good passionate about animals it's what I want to do so I decided to go here I won't really know why my parents are making me come talk to you I guess I think I have an anxiety problem or something whole thing is actually pretty stupid if you ask me  \nT:\twell I've heard ohio  is a pretty nice place to live and the veterinary program is great here at UT um tell me a little bit more about why your parents think you should come to counseling \nC:\tall right fine my parents told me that if I didn't go see a counselor than they wouldn't pay my tuition anymore and I don't work while I'm in school and i would say tuition is astronomical but i guess they might be kind of worried because i haven't met a lot of people here in Tennessee I don't know it's just so different from Ohio I had a lot of friends back home I was even homecoming queen in high school and I don't know things are just so different I've been having trouble making friends so I guess I've just been throwing myself more into my school work and I mean I really do get anxious sometimes about school sometimes I feel like I've changed employees but it doesn't everyone  \nT:\twow what a big transition for you to move from Ohio to Tennessee takes a really strong person to be able to do that so I hear that you're kind of lonely hearing to this II and things are really different from back home so you're too been trying to keep yourself busy with school school work and sometimes you get overwhelmed\nC:\tyeah my parents told me that I've been having anxiety attacks what do they know I mean they're not even here I guess they could be right I don't know I feel like I just don't have time for this I really need to be studying  \nT:\tokay I hear what you're saying that your studies are really important to you let's try to focus on why we're here today tell me more about feeling overwhelmed with school \nC:\twell there's just so much work I'm taking  hours I heard they have any time to do it or anything that I even want to do I really just want to do well in school but not my parents are riding me about this counseling thing it's just way too much I don't think that i exactly need counseling but I guess I'm here so here I am okay  \nT:\tso it sounds like you have a large workload and you already have a lot on your plate and now your parents are nagging you about going to counseling \nC:\tyeah that sounds pretty overwhelming and I don't know I mean I had a big course load in high school I took AP classes I play two sports after school softball and basketball I was in several clubs and on committees and I was a little stressed out then but I didn't get worked up then like I do now I feel like I was much better able to manage stress then not like now  \nT:\tokay see so you had a lot of commitments in high school you did get stressed out but that was a little different it was a lower level stress compared to how you're feeling now it sounds like you had control over your stress level that time what did you do differently in high school to help you alleviate this stress \nC:\tnothing I guess but I had a lot of friends at the time we're all going through the same thing and I guess I felt like I've always had someone to talk to other than my parents you know we would always go to dinner or hang out together after school we were go shopping even if we didn't have money I felt like they really really cared about me I felt it felt so good to vent people who really knew what was going on but then we all went to different colleges and we all just kind of lost touch  \nT:\tokay so it sounds like you felt like you had a lot of people that you could turn to at that time and now you can exactly turn to them like you once did because you decided to go off to different schools \nC:\tyeah I really did and my friends back home really helped me through a lot of tough times  \nT:\tit sounds like it so what do you think it would be like here at UT if you would continue to go to counseling and we're eventually able to feel less overwhelmed than how you feel now about your course load \nC:\tI mean I guess that would be okay actually it would be really nice to not feel so stressed all the time I hate it when i get so stressed that i can't breathe it's really scary I just can't catch my breath but I don't know I really don't have time for this I have so much homework I need to get done every day I mean I'm taking  hours it's a lot  \nT:\tokay so on one hand you feel like it would be a relief to be less stressed and overwhelmed about your schoolwork and then on the other hand you feel like you just don't have time to go to counseling because you have so much work to do \nC:\tyeah exactly I feel kind of like it's a double-edged sword \nT:\tand um what worries you about the anxiety you've been feeling lately \nC:\thmm I guess it would be really tough to get through school if I was so stressed out all the time like this but I do think I would be able to get through it I'm a really good student but I don't know I just wish I could figure out how to manage my stress well just like I did in high school  \nT:\tokay so you're really devoted to your studies and you think that you could be able to get through it but you're hoping to find some new techniques to help you manage your stress while you're here at UT \nC:\tyeah I guess that's why my parents want me to see a counselor to kind of help me figure out how to become less stressed I don't know I feel like my parents just won't get off my back about the counseling thing you need to talk to a professional about how you feel over and over every time to talk on the phone it's like a broken record honestly I just think that they are trying to control me just like they did in high school always telling you do your homework get good grades stand up straight stop texting at the dinner table oh it was exhausting I haven't met anyone here that gets me  \nT:\tso it sounds like your parents have been voicing a lot of concern about you lately and they really care about what's going on with you and it makes you feel like you did when you live with them in high school and it's hard because you can't find anybody here that you can fit two \nC:\tyeah I mean I guess you could say it like that they do really care about me and I have made a few acquaintances in my classes but the other day one of them told me that I get more stressed out than I shebin like where does he get off telling you that I don't know being here without my real friends makes me feel like no one is really paying attention to me  \nT:\tokay so you feel like you don't have a single person here in Knoxville that cares about you \nC:\twell no I mean the people I met in class did seem concerned about me I just don't feel quite as close to them as I did to my friends back up I could talk to my friends about coming about anything I mean anything they were always there no matter what  \nT:\tokay um so you do feel like there are a few people here and not spill that are concerned about you um let's do some activities that I like to do with some of my clients um and then we can talk about them I like to call this first activity the confidence ruler okay so go there's just a little scale on there and on a scale from one to ten can you show me how confident you are that you will eventually be able to manage your stress and figure how to manage it better okay I fancy so you pointed to his six um can you tell me a little bit about why you pointed to a six why not a zero \nC:\twell I don't know i was able to figure out how to cope with a busy schedule while i was in high school why can't you do it now I was just able I was able to do it then I'm sure I could do it now even though i do think that i'm just unsure i don't have the same social outlet that i had my doubts back home going through stressful situations and the work is just so much harder here in college  hours is a lot \nT:\tokay I hear you so on one hand you feel confident that you're able to manage this home course load and the stress level and on the other hand you're unsure because you don't have the same social support it's like you did back home \nC:\tyeah I would say that I feel like I might be able to I would like to think I could I don't know the course load is just so big and things are so different here than they were back home  I see so you're a little torn well let's do this I like to call this a self-care assessment it helps me get a better idea of where my clients personal values are um so just take a moment to look over that and fill it out would you like something to drink i'm going to go get some water myself no thanks okay I'll be right back um so let me know in your finish ok  i'm right um let's see what we have so it seems like a social life and education are very important to you um you also rated family and physical self care pretty highly um tell me about that\nC:\twell I've always really liked right staying in shape I used to run all the time back home I even did half marathon it really helped me clear my head sometimes it always stayed focused in school um I just haven't had much time here to do that if any at all plus I really don't know the area that well it's a new city even a new state and I'm always getting these crazy emails from UT saying people are getting stabbed all the time I guess I'm just kind of scared to go out  \nT:\tso you're a little out of your comfort running zone so to say you don't feel as comfortable running here as you did back at home with your friends yeah I would say so okay um tell me more about your family rating on that assessment \nC:\tmy family well of course I love them they're huge part of my life I mean they're my family I just I don't know I'm actually kind of mad at them for making me go through all this counseling stuff I'm in college now and they're not here I should know what's best haha and now they hold this tuition thing over my head they know I can't afford the tuition here so i just feel kind of forced I mean maybe I could pay for my tuition on my own I mean what should i do what would you do  \nT:\twell that's a pretty tough decision and um well I really think that you have the personal capabilities to come to that decision on your own I can tell from talking to you that you're a point in your life where you can make big decisions like that on your own \nC:\tyeah you're probably right you could say that I really feel like I have ensured since being here at UT okay um so you feel like you've done a lot of growing up \nT:\tyeah so it seems like we've uncovered a lot of ground today I feel like I have a better sense of who you are where you come from and how do you feel about coming back to talk to me well I still really like that my parents are making me do this but I guess it would keep them off my back for a while and who knows maybe it'll help I feel like you'll be able to find your fit here at UT I really do and I look forward to our next session  \n",
  "﻿T:\thoney I think you have a fairly uncomplicated respiratory infection I don't see anything that would indicate a need for antibiotics what I would suggest I'll give you the name of a cough suppressant that you can buy over the counter and I think it should run its course within the next few days \nC:\tokay\nT:\tgood I also notice you filled out one of our questionnaires could I look up your question there give a bit feedback that he all right? okay and just to clarify from my information on average how many days a week would you have a drink that contains um alcohol? \nC:\tum I don't drink very often if I go out to dinner with my friends I may have one or two glasses of wine \nT:\tokay and about how often would that be?\nC:\tum like every other month I guess maybe go out to dinner\nT:\tokay and only and one or two drinks when you have a drink?\nC:\tyes mm-hmm um \nT:\tin the past three months a notice you filled out our drug use questionnaire can you tell me what drugs you used any street drugs or any prescription drugs in a way that was not prescribed? \nC:\tum prescription sure if I only use those as their prescribed but i have used marijuana or i do use marijuana occasionally \nT:\tokay not about how often would you use marijuana? \nC:\tmaybe two or three times a month \nT:\tmm-hmm and on a typical day that you smoke marijuana about how much would you smoke too many joints?\nC:\tum well I'm usually with friends and um looks like they'll roll a blunt and we'll pass it around a couple of times I guess I may have anywhere from seven to eight pups I guess sohini mm-hmm just you know it depends on how many up there's of us there are when it goes around \nT:\tokay all right well your score on this questionnaire is a  out of a possible  points would you like to know a little bit more about what your score means? \nC:\tyes please\nT:\twe have a little diagram that we use to represent people's risk levels there are people with no use that would have no risk and others that are drinking I'm sorry smoking perhaps on a very frequent or even daily level that would be in a high-risk group but your use puts you in this middle zone which indicates that you do have some risk related to your marijuana use what are your thoughts about that? \nC:\tMike at risk for what \nT:\twell marijuana is a drug that affects learning and memory and coordination and so on the days that you do smoke marijuana more likely to have an accident a fall or if you're driving maybe an auto accident there's some other health effects some of the ones that I worried the most about anxiety and depression and especially paranoid ideations and schizophrenia you ever had any problems when you were out smoking marijuana with friends?\nC:\tum well yeah recently the last time that we were smoking I did experience some paranoia and that that wasn't a good feeling at all that really scare me \nT:\tokay so that's pretty frightening very yeah well can you give me a little more idea some of the good things some of the reasons that you do smoke marijuana you like to do that? \nC:\tum no you know just it kind of helps you to relax kind of mellow out it's not something that I plan to do is just if my friends are smoking and I'm around then I will you know joining in um it's just you know that social thing is I really didn't see it as a big deal\nT:\tyeah so it's a social thing something that you do to sort of be a part of the group and it helps you relax a little any not-so-good things you mentioned one thing that's \nC:\tyeah you're ready yeah well whenever I smoke you know I'm always concerned about my job testing for for dress because they do random drug tests and I really can't afford to lose my job and the paranoia was really scary for me that that last time that was the first time I had ever experienced that and it was just no real crazy whoa crazy \nT:\tso on the one hand you have this opportunity to relax a little bit and just enjoy spending time with your friends on the other hand you've got some things that have made you concerned the paranoia really scares you and you're also really concerned about the possibility that get drug tested that might endanger your job so where does that that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke about like you are now or maybe quitting or reducing what you're doing?\nC:\twell after i had that um that experience with the paranoia that really scared me and so it was something that you know I was like I really you know don't want to do this I don't want to have this feeling anymore so I think it may be better if I just leave it alone \nT:\tyeah might be time to quit yeah you know as your physician I would say that's a great decision because none of these bad things would happen T as least as a consequence of your drug use if you quit quit completely so I think that's a that's a great choice what would you say if if you go out with your friends? you sounds like you do that on a regular basis next time you go out you say no I how are you gonna say no?\nC:\tum you know I really haven't thought about it it's just there's something I have to really think about how to to to deal with it when it happens yeah so I \nT:\tput a little thought into that some people talk about their health or problems that they've had or some people just say I made a decision I don't want to do yeah yeah you can kind of think through those and come up with something that you think would work for you and your situation and the people that you go out on with \nC:\tI think they'll understand that has that parent being paranoid you know and just them seeing me that way I think don't understand if I say no uh-huh \nT:\tso someone were actually upon expiry yes yeah so that may help them understand well I think that's a great decision Tonya as i said i want to give you today some information i'll write out the name of that cough suppressant for you okay and you know i'll see you for your next annual vision when that comes due or are you know how to find us before then if you need us \nC:\tokay all right \nT:\tgood well thanks for talking with me about this today I know these are not the easiest things to talk but I think you've demonstrated some really clear thinking and let me know if there's any way I can help \nC:\tokay thank you   \n",
  "﻿T:\twell Terry I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on with you you got some anxiety that's related to not having enough work to do in the economic stress that that's causing for you let me ask you about something else sometimes use of alcohol or drugs can contribute to anxiety I notice that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires could I take a look at that and maybe give you a little feedback? this one that's right yeah that's it okay and let me just clarify how much alcohol or drugs you might be using on average how many days a week or month would you have a drink that contains alcohol?\nC:\toh no no alcohol use at all I don't drink at all alcoholism isn't my family so so is it something I just I choose to stay away from \nT:\tokay so zero alcohol yeah no very good no risk related to that I know she did fill out our drug questionnaire though could you tell me in the past three months what what drugs you've used any street drugs or any prescription medications in a way that was not prescribed? \nC:\tyeah while going to tell you I use marijuana pretty much every day uh-huh you know yeah so \nT:\ton a typical day how many joints or blunts would you smoke?\nC:\tI'll I'll smoke on a typical day really to at least one or two joints a day \nT:\tuh-huh okay yeah what's some of the good things about smoking marijuana? for you most people who smoke do it because they as does something good for them\nC:\twell for me it's been you know with the again with the stress of everything that's going on it's just that me time that I get to just sort of relax for me so all right let's get away yeah exactly exactly \nT:\tso mm-hmm that's um what other good things about smoking marijuana for you? \nC:\twell you know in college I've got a back injury from football and I will say that when I when I used to marijuana it does help relieve the pain \nT:\tlet's get some pain relief from it um what some of the not so good things for you about smoking marijuana?\nC:\twell it's funny you ask that I know that a few years ago it affected my my license for trucking they they did drug testing and who course I never used why was why was why was driving but it wasn't my system so I lost my license how long so that was big real big real big financially it's put a hit on everything so well ya know \nT:\twhat are the not so good things if any about smoking marijuana?\nC:\twell my my wife she tends to bring it up that it's a bad influence for the kids you know we we did use together when the kids came along she she stopped but I continued to use but I guess I forgot to use another issue that comes up it is between me and the wife that no using it has not been a good example for the kids\nT:\tstress or conflict there because I'm definitely that yeah so on the one hand it does give you some me time and an ability to kind of get away and relax and maybe manage your back pain a little bit better right on the other hand it's a it's had some big job consequences and in addition to that now scream friction in your relationship with your wife and as you physician I can tell you one of the medical consequences of smoking marijuana is that sometimes it actually increases anxiety sometimes just from the drug itself or sometimes as it's going out of your system you get a little withdrawal symptoms related to to the anxiety so you've got some good things some not-so-good things where does that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke to see them out or maybe cutting back or quitting?\nC:\twe will today you've given me a lot to think about I mean you know you know first a job and then of course my wife and did now I'm hearing it from you so you got me thinking is \nT:\tinformation is kind of mounting for you \nC:\tyeah it is it is\nT:\twell let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero would be not ready to make any change or ten would be on I'm really ready to make a significant change today where would you put yourself in terms of being ready to cut back or I'll quit your marijuana use?\nC:\thmm that's a good skill zero to ten they I'm gonna say five \nT:\tmm-hmm right in the middle \nC:\tyeah just just because of yeah that's \nT:\twhy I want five and not a three or a two?\nC:\twell wouldn't put it as low as three or two because I just like I share it with you just you know with my job and that I lost lost my license with it being an issue that comes up between me and my wife and then now today it's hot you know I I would say that's probably reason why I got it out of five because you I don't know \nT:\tyeah so you've got some things that are really making you think about it yeah well let me tell you what I thought we might do with your anxiety today I thought we might start you on a medication that's very safe non addicting I try probably some sertraline medicine that you take every day and slowly it's not going to take away your anxiety immediately but will slowly bring down the anxiety level in your life and then we also could engage in some counseling if you're interested somebody who could help you learn to deal with stress think through the issue of what to do about your marijuana use and also do some marital counseling between your wife if you lie what do you thoughts about?\nC:\tthat okay well on the cow side let me let me check let me check with my wife first okay CFS something she wants to wants to do uh hmm yeah don't think about that no \nT:\tI will take it and think about it and if you decide you want to do that just give a call back here to the office we can set that up\nC:\tokay all right \nT:\twhat about a next step for you in terms of your marijuana use what would you like to do about that?\nC:\twell based on you and based on what I've been here and I guess I need to go ahead and try and cut back a little bit you know baby I can just tried tried going how long ain't gonna make no promises maybe just say maybe three three days a week rather than the rule I can try to do that just cut back into weekends or something yeah yeah like that let me just sort of think through\nT:\twell Terry I think that's a good plan I'll write your prescription you can pick that up at the desk on the way out start taking your medication if you and your wife decide you want to go for with the counseling just call back to the office here and we'll set that up I will see you in three to four weeks and I have a handout for you that I'd like to give you it has a lot of medical facts about marijuana we find a lot of people are not familiar with all of the different medical and mental health complications you can get from marijuana but it's something we'll give you a little bit more information to think about \nC:\tokay all right I appreciate this and Wow I'll take a look at it \nT:\tokay very good and I'll plan to see you back in three to four weeks\nC:\tall right thank you doctor  ",
  "﻿T:\thygena i haven't seen you in a few weeks I know it was hard for you to come today and it's kind of a hard process so so I'm really glad that you came today just want to check in and see how things are going \nC:\tbeen in a couple fights with my mom cut a few times but not as much as before \nT:\tso you've cut a couple times since we've met but not as much as before did have a few fights with your mom so Gina and tell me about where you're at in terms of your feelings about cutting and what your thoughts are about changing that behavior \nC:\tI know it's bad but I don't sometimes I just want to do it because I know it'll help me feel better right away I don't know that having a bath will make me feel better right away necessarily if \nT:\tyou have mixed feelings about it it sounds to me like there's some good things about it and you know it is helpful light makes you feel better right away and you're not entirely sure that having a bath and the mini make hid is going to work as quickly or work as well so there's sort of two sides of it for you wondering if the mini vacation and the having a bath will be is helpful for you what did some of the drawbacks to having a bath and doing the mini vacation do you think? \nC:\tI guess there's nothing bad about it really I'm just used to having that me release when I cut \nT:\tso it's maybe not as immediate for you you have to draw the bath that may take a bit more time yes it's a different it's different what are some of the good positive parts about how choosing to do have a bath and self-soothe in that way do you think?\nC:\tit's relaxing it I get to be clean and smell good again listen to my music like it's sort of like a treat for me so and I don't wake up the next day with scarves \nT:\tit's maybe a big one for you right that you're waking up your don't have any scars you got to listen to your music you got to you're smelling good right you're feeling good maybe \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tso you listed lots of positives but it's you know there's still these two parts of yourself remember in some of the other sessions we've had we talked about what Eugenia person what you value and what's important to you do you remember what those things where we thought we identified?\nC:\tone was independence and two was privacy yeah those are the main things \nT:\tso independence and privacy were important to you in terms of you know what you value in your life so when you think about independence and you think about privacy where do you see cutting impacting that like how does that fit with those two things how does cutting fit with independence why don't we start there \nC:\tI decide to cut myself and it's my own my decision \nT:\tso you there's independence in terms of those choices okay any consequences of cutting on your independence do you think \nC:\tit's not a good thing yeah I'm in control but it doesn't work out for the best \nT:\tso that you are in control but it doesn't work out for the best yeah and there has been some consequences in terms of your mom curtailing your independence based on your cutting \nC:\tdefinitely she takes away my independence and so it seems like a bad cycle \nT:\tso your mom was sort of pulling back on your independence when and it gets into a bad cycle \nC:\tand then which makes me more mad which makes me want to cut again \nT:\tit becomes a real vicious circle almost like yeah how will privacy what is how does cutting effect privacy for you that value? \nC:\tit impacts it in a bad way because I have to be private about hiding my scarves but it's kind of a good way to because I get to do it in private nobody else sees me and so I feel good about having that private thing but only I can do \nT:\tit needs to happen in private and that being wanting to be in private at cutting those two things go together but the downside is that you're almost required to be private because you have to hide yourself and be so conscious all the time of covering up and keeping the secret so you talked about having mixed feelings about deciding to counter not cut there's lots of different feelings for you about that one of the things I wondered about is you know if you imagine what what would things look like for you for you in a year from now if cutting is still in your life do you envision it would look like you know so you'd be one year older Zeb  what do you think when you imagine that \nC:\tjust feel like it will probably be worse I feel like I'll have way more scarce like they could even be somewhere else not just my arms right maybe my legs because if I just keep going then there'd be nowhere else to cut and they just could get really bad I think lots more scars I would not even have a chance of going back on the swim team at all for doing anything like that I think it would be bad\nT:\tso if just feel like there'd be lots of consequences down the road there'd be lots more scarce maybe more spots and really afraid that it wouldn't be an option to go on the swim team that big bad for you \nC:\tyeah I feel like right now I could probably go back if I stop cutting but if I keep and once I heal it could be okay but if I keep going the way I'm going I don't know if I could hide it and might stick around forever \nT:\tso you have hope right now that you could return to the swim team and that is important to you \nC:\tyeah  ",
  "﻿T:\tno no hi I'm very hard to I'm very late you're very low okay okay so \nT:\tI see you've got yourself a cup of tea yeah how do you think I can help right \nC:\tI'd like to once and for all stop even thinking about what I do to my health I just do the right thing does it certainly \nT:\twell well the way you say that sounds like you've tried this in the past and and for once and for all is I'm really determined this time \nC:\tyeah whatever else happens I just want to shut up the Health Committee in my head but you know rub it's on at me about dude don't because I'm largely very good at looking after and by half of me really I mean diet and exercise what I eat and how look after my body \nT:\tso you have some internal voices that's disputing probably maybe wait okay with you whether you should or shouldn't exercise and diet look after your health\nC:\twell as earn full I like to exercise and I feel good when I exercise  and I'm in the habit of getting the habit of exercise for about only forty percent of an average week when I look at it so for forty percent spine isn't it I mean it's more than I do no it's not I want to like when I say forty soutar would that mean in terms of time I mean only forty percent of the time do I really follow what I've said I'll do what I like doing what I want to do \nT:\tso so sixty percent of the time you don't follow what you really want to do what you do \nC:\tI talking idea man identified said she's exactly right but it feels a bit like that feels like I know what I want I go in you know a bit of coaching on some stuff I set out to do it I feel really good when I do it and then I very easily seem to let it go because um it's evening time or on the way traveling or something \nT:\tso sometimes what you want to do is is as distracted by other things yeah and sometimes you find yourself not doing the things that you want to do and you think you're not sure that that might be as much as six percent in third\nC:\tyeah I think I'm kidding myself thinking I'm on a good track sometimes \nT:\toh well I just don't just stop you there because I'd like you too much to be focused really what is it precisely that you want I mean at the moment it seems a bit vague here tell me what you really want?\nC:\ti want to write what I honestly want is to fit into all my size  trousers thank you and I want to feel good about myself and whatever I I almost want to not even think about what I'm eating because I just eat things that give me energy to the things that suck my energy or make me blueberry \nT:\tokay so you you don't want to be thinking about what you're eating just sort of it naturally happens that you eat all the things that give you energy rather than eat things that take the energy way \nC:\tyeah and if I don't do those things like if I have biscuits because I'm a pig really with biscuits and chocolate so I tend not to have them most of the time actually well I think it's both time but then what I do is fine I can hear myself saying or watching listen oh you should believe that bum doing \nT:\tso much the Health Committee the Health Committee kicks in zone though so you find yourself doing things that aren't what you really want and when you are doing things that you don't really want you've got an internal voice telling you that you're doing this wrong\nC:\tyeah and sometimes \nT:\tlike everybody everybody does you know things that are wrong I mean what differences in range\nC:\twell there is some people seem to it's not really some people seem to have it crap that they can do and I've have periods of my life where I've had it crack that I just do what I do because it's all falls into place I \nT:\tso you've been able to do this before you've been able to what eat healthily take exercise get into size -\nC:\tsorry honestly it well that's not in my in my Raider okay\nT:\tso okay you clear about that yep and so it won't feel good about yourself and you've managed that before \nC:\tyeah I actually do that our Lily was born I was really fit and it was a pleasure it was a complete pleasure and you know I've had bounced of that since just like at the moment that comes to somewhere i'm going to those  that it doesn't really matter what size I'm innocence that's the right size for me it's just like ah\nT:\tsounds a bit one quite frustrating for you \nC:\tyeah I'm frustrated with myself yeah and as I've said to you before I'm even bored with saying this i'm bored with myself yeah this is boring it's like instead of balkan back relaxed and confident \nT:\tso you've relaxed and confident eating only the things that can give you energy refusing the things that aren't and then the voice I don't show you\nC:\twhatever I want enjoying whatever I do cheese okay alright so that's close \nT:\tthat just leaves me a little bit puzzled been really because you clearly you enjoy the biscuit \nC:\tso you know what I at least it's a start and I can't tell you how quickly i had fun right I'd I think I didn't want my mom used to call posting them you know I don't know even hardly tasted them I just like one them in my mouth with a cup of tea and it's not that satisfying \nC:\treally \nT:\tvery temporary very very very very quick \nT:\tif you could shut up the voices that were saying now you shouldn't do this man and in there well then you didn't draw the biscuits with you so shutting up the voices is really what you need to do yeah do you know\nC:\twhat I think I need bigger photo biscuits and that's for bit longer yeah yeah \nT:\tso there's no free showcase they just done yeah obviously not suitable for you obviously not suitable for you so so I mean if you could get bigger biscuits if you could get biscuits that lasted a bit longer yeah and if you could shut the voices off job done \nC:\tand keep up the physical exercise sign which I have done a lot of actually I've made want to take quite found changes this year I'm not all that visible but they are there I don't know deliver really which is good for \nT:\twhat exactly \nC:\tthey're just thinks it made a difference to my general house for the personal things really hope she turn into your  no but it probably will there's a lot of course straight stuff i needed to do which i've done and doing that's Wrecking I've got that absolutely crowd a big thing a physio I've got really good measurable feedback\nT:\twell that's not a very proactive then\nC:\tyeah that is very proactive \nT:\tso so you can't happy without you actually taking some steps and done some things there around the road to this sort of this healthy person in a size and if I'm right and thinking is it's not just the  it's the health and feeling good about feeling good about this \nC:\tis practical I've got about you know pairs of trousers at the size  why don't want to be uncomfortable in there when I can be comfortable in that could you sell them and get sixteenths with me no i don't to do like so they don't hang well my hips okay \nT:\twell that sounds like you've barely determined to get this done so i suppose what still puzzles me is there you are really quite determined to to make some some good healthy giant lasting long are you really bored and sick to death of the internal diet committee going \nC:\tmy agent Lee why don't you get about it \nT:\tyeah yeah so I don't know it sounds to me like you probably you probably you know the only half hearted about their sorry \nC:\tthat's the thing I I think I'm not half hearted but sometimes act like I'm half hearted so as I am I am it is important to me \nT:\thow important?\nC:\tI think it's about that important \nT:\tokay but that important \nC:\tyeah I was just think that was that a measuring stick to be important important nine out of ten I guess \nT:\ton a scale that yeah yeah okay so where are you at the moment if if they your success rate at the moment is?\nC:\tpretty shit is there well it's not actually because you've reminded me that the physio stuff has been coerced really good and that's that's been around a health issue so I now done with stuff with that \nT:\tso answers was celebrating that success \nC:\tyeah yeah it is actually yeah but you're still in this not really sure about the biscuits \nC:\tit's not just a biscuit you know they're all committees well it's like I'm lying in bed this morning i'm thinking i'll do my half hour pilates you've got nice space in the in the little hole now we've moved the desk out okay i'll do that before work and now you are at work a little bit and again i have dialogue about that i'll do this tomorrow you know I'll swim I'll get swimming on Wednesday peas on my home nice aerobic exercise so in my timetable stay so I have the conversation about life as well you know what i will do some are a \nT:\tI don't know that doesn't seem very serious to me really if you know it's like so yeah do it tomorrow nice do dresses what bullets\nC:\tthat's exactly it is that I am serious and I'm not I'm not doing it \nT:\tso what do you need to do to make that leap you know what what I don't know no i'm not sure i'm not really sure that you really are not motivated the biscuits and and they not bothering to exercise seems to be quite quite a nice thing for you too to counter play \nC:\tshort turn that's what I'm saying \nT:\tand long term it's all in the story \nC:\tabout this the pressures over like that and \nT:\tthen they'd sugar ups and down to Italy and the fat stomach at the long-term effect so flat stomach for teens feeling good by itself and being healthy that's a long term so the short term how to subvert our Thursday yeah yeah and yet that you've still got these voices are telling you you sabotaging yourself \nC:\tyes I suppose they're quite useful what was my I'd like shut them up as well or perhaps sure wonder if the voices could be useful mountain because just as I said that then I was thinking they're telling me I'm sabotage myself\nT:\tyou ignore him \nC:\twhich is good isn't it because if I listen to them that's quite a good message to get if you just I never saw that before have you seen this pests\nT:\tso Tess boring press is the way you've seen them yeah and now what \nC:\tI suppose the fact I'm know that I want to do this and that identifying that difference between the short and the long term \nT:\tyou really want to do this \nC:\tyes I want to be doing it now \nT:\tyou really do\nC:\tyeah like so today i already am i've started today well they haven't have had biscuits of her things I mean it sounds so bloody trivial as they both it site\nT:\twhich is trivial isn't it \nC:\twell it's not\nT:\tjust my computer okay just give me it's not true \nC:\tno it's not true you're winning because it's not triple for a number of reasons but I think about it I'm just thinking about health I know that I've got I've got a chronic blood disorder which is not that serious it's just there but the effect it has on me is to diminish my energy sometimes so I know that those short-term sugar fixes for example an awkward for that from the research i've looked at they're just not good so it's not trivial actually\nT:\tokay so it's not true this is sabores out you are determined you didn't want to make the changes you not really sure now about whether those those boring purity Health Committee voices are useful or not useful \nC:\tknow so um don't worry sure I I forget how important it is you do okay and they tried to remind you so the so when I say to myself because obviously it's me I don't really have anybody else in my head so it's like it needs to be different message that I'm telling myself does it because you see I forget about this what's called you two pina stuff yeah until I remember about it \nT:\tso they don't look so yes sir \nC:\tso I don't think about that when I'm you know unplanned and grubbing what I can I get really hungry than I crumb fooding run and really I prefer savory food mostly \nT:\tokay \nC:\tI really do love chocolate and I'd like chocolates a treat you know to have some town and the KUSI's shut the fuck up for when I'm having chocolate so that I can just if I'm going to do it I want to enjoy it fully\nT:\tokay ah  C \tDallas out then understand for myself all the time that for me you know with neutropenia and with just just me my lifestyle and what it is that actually looking after the physical me is just really important right \nT:\tso those voices were saying that yes and they also cheered you on when you're eating chocolate hey yeah they're nothing don't don't what don't you sort of reinstall this determination to get healthy and fit in and fill good about yourself \nC:\tyes and when I like today cuz you know it's a busy week away again us away from home most of us we can again all this week it's like what about the exercise \nT:\tmmm \nC:\tyes I think my mind and body are all connected yeah okay \nT:\tso so good to have committee help you were there with the exercise \nC:\tyes \nT:\tI'm not I'm just hearing you saying that there's a resource that you could before you thought was a nuisance \nC:\tthe Health Committee

  "﻿T:\tI can great to see you today nice to see you too so I understand your smoker and I wonder if you would talk with me about your smoking?\nC:\tsure I'll be \nT:\tall right and so can you describe for me your pattern of tobacco use?\nC:\tuh it's sort of sporadic I mean it mostly revolves around either  i'm drinking with friends or or when I have you know emotions that I don't know how to deal with whether it's anger frustration or sadness or loneliness or pretty much any emotion that couldn't feel good yeah and \nT:\tso how many cigarettes would you say that you have you smoked each day?\nC:\tuh like I said I'm sporadic I don't smoke the same every day but on average maybe a half a pack a day I mean it could be none one day and then the full pack another day and so but maybe on average a half a pack \nT:\tokay and how soon after you wake up in the mornings do you have your first cigarette?\nC:\tuh you know it's not right away from me normally I in most days it will probably when I'm in in the car and the way to work you know and just it's one of those places where I'm in a car and start the car and light a cigarette and you know follows right afterwards \nT:\twell it seems like you have a lot of awareness of your triggers for smoking \nC:\tuh yeah you know I don't I don't I think crave it in a way that I think maybe most people do all the time I just have situations for sure that that I by smoking you know \nT:\tokay and how long have you been smoking?\nC:\tI had my first cigarette when I was  years old\nT:\tand has your pattern been the same since then?\nC:\tuh you know what varies a little bit but but it's mostly been like that you know I never smoked a lot more than I do right now or really even a lot less it's mostly been mostly about same on average \nT:\tand so are you interested in stopping smoking?\nC:\tuh yeah I mean I I I quit all the time frankly I I've thrown away you know half full packs and and and swear I'm done and then I think I'm done but it only lasts for for a few days and then you know either I'm out with friends drinking all right I I get upset and then and then without even thinking about it I go and buy a pack on I'm a smoker again yeah \nT:\tand so those times when you decide to quit what are your reasons for quitting?\nC:\tuh well i think i'm stupid for smoking you know i mean i think everybody knows that it's horrible for you and do awful things to you and your lung cancer and kill you you know and then i have asthma too and so put it on top of that and I you know more recently I've seen family members die lung cancer and it's awful a horrible way to go you know and so it seems more real and I I don't want to do that to myself I wouldn't want anybody I care about to smoke and yet somehow I keep doing it to myself you know I I sort of can't believe that I choose to do it and yet i choose to do it without thinking all the time \nT:\tbut it seems like it really fits in with your lifestyle with the friends that you spend time with and\nC:\tyeah we we all work nights we all go out afterwards we all drink and smoke and you know I I don't think i could really imagine being out of them and watching them smoking me not doing it to you know I just it would do all it takes is being around it you know and I'm smoke with them \nT:\tyeah well it sounds like it's really it helps you to connect with them and part of socializing \nC:\twell yeah I mean yeah I don't they don't pressure me to do or anything it's just being having it all around me you know and having a drink in one hand you know like it's it's like it couldn't be any other way you know just being being around it and and and and people spoken and I'm I'm gonna smoke with them too \nT:\tit also sounds like when you're really feeling bad or feeling negative emotions that it's the one thing that you know you can go to and for a little while anyways it helps you to feel better \nC:\tuh yeah I with any kind of emotion that I don't know how to deal with it just feels like a ton of pressure inside of me and and and smoking two cigarettes like pushing the pressure release valve you know like I just but I feel relief and I don't feel nearly as angry or sad or frustrated or whatever  and and so it does what I mean it to do I guess \nT:\tlet's stop here so we can discuss what you have seen so far consider the following questions how do you think this conversation is going so far? how effective is the assessment? are there other questions you want to ask? what have we learned so far about Kens smoking pattern and history? what are your initial thoughts about potential tobacco cessation medications and counseling strategies? let's see what happens next and so right now in this moment can you talk with me about you know how ready are you to quit? so on a scale from one to ten one being not ready to quit it all and ten being you know you would set a quit date right now where are you? c\t at huh you know I would say maybe six or seven i would say I'd be I'd be happy to be done you know I'd be happy if I didn't ever smoke again I just I just don't really believe it's going to happen I guess you know I like I said I quit all the time and now it's even sort of a joke that that me Quinton's like not quitting at all it just means I'm out  t\tum okay well did you know though that um people who quit without any sort of assistance using any tobacco cessation medications or counseling have a four percent chance of success of quitting in the long term \nC:\tyou know I that sort of discouraging I guess that no one can get away from it you know but I guess I'm not the only one \nT:\tum but there are some cessation medications and aids that can really help you to successfully quit \nC:\twhat a kind of things you're talking about \nT:\twell there are things like um the patch or the gum so nicotine replacement therapy there's also other medications as well as counseling where it could really help you learn and practice some strategies to help you stop smoking especially at those times when you're really triggered or you have some real cravings they'd have to be really good techniques\nC:\ti think you know I but like i said i don't i'm so convinced that i'm done each time that I quit and then and then I start again and I don't even think about it you know there's whatever technique would have to uh has a lot to overcome I think in my case \nT:\tso so then that leaves me to asking you about your confidence level so if you could rate yourself your confidence level about your ability to quit on a scale from one to ten one being not having any confidence at all and ten being yeah I know I can do it this time where are you at with that \nC:\tuh you know i would say maybe you two maybe a three out you know I I don't know you know I can go like I said a day or two without smoking but I've never gone for good you know I all I need is you back in that situation again either upset or out with friends and I'm right back and so I just I have a hard time believing I have a hard time even imagining a world in which I really wouldn't wouldn't go to smoke when uh when times get tough I guess \nT:\tyeah well and so can you talk with me a bit more about the reasons why you would really want to be quit?\nC:\tso there's health reasons \nT:\tyeah um is there anything else that really you know is one of the reasons why you would want to quit?\nC:\tuh you know i just i don't i don't want to live this way where I do things that to myself and I wouldn't do to anybody i love you know I wouldn't want any any loved one to smoke you know and but somehow I I do it to myself you know and and and and I'm trying to start exercising you know doing some running in some hike in and and and then I get short of breath and I cough and I'm worn out if I smoked a lot the day before and and I'm not sure you can choose both smoke and ends being in good shape you know I just I just I don't I don't believe in me making that choice I guess to be healthy and \nT:\tso it really does sound like for you quitting smoking would be an expression a self love \nC:\ti would i would have to love me more i guess to get there like I said I would I would I would want anybody I loved and not smoke and so if I I chose to not smoke if I was actually be able to do it I think it would have to be because because I cared enough about me to do it\nT:\tyeah and so your confidence you said is that a two or three why not a one \nC:\tyou know because I do go days a time sometimes without smoking I mean as long as I'm not in a situation that sort of forces me to do it you know as long as i'm not out with friends drinking or as long as I don't have some situation gets me upset than I don't I don't feel it has control over me you know just in those situations where there's nothing else I can do you know but smooth \nT:\twell it sounds like quitting smoking is really important to you but that you know you don't really feel confident and you're not sure about what strategies are out there to help you and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to meet and talk with one of our tobacco treatment specialist who can we tell you what your options are get you connected to resources to help you quit would you be willing to do that? \nC:\tyou know like I said they gotta have something pretty special I mean I outside of them coming to the bar with me and not going to figure it out of my hands I'm not sure what they can do but but I I don't want to keep Quentin I want to quit one more time and it'd be it'd be it you know so we'll give them a try \nT:\tyeah well in like you said you know you've quit many times before and for multiple days and that is a real success and I know that because you ended up going back to smoking that it doesn't feel like a real success but certainly being able to stop for hours or days at a time is really an accomplishment and I hope you can feel that \nC:\twell it feels like something maybe I mean I'm better off having a few days often then smoking a pack every day but but i don't i don't think you'd really quit until you really quit you know like i don't i don't think my quit and I know you really want to quit I don't I don't know that there's anything better I could do for myself if I could actually do it \nT:\tokay so if I connect you with them with the tts you'll um follow up with them and talk with them about it?\nC:\tI'll give them a try \nT:\tin our next meeting we can check in and see how things went for you \nC:\tall right \nT:\tokay well wonderful great talking with you it's good talking you  ",

  "﻿T:\tWhat  can i do to help?\nC:\tyeah well the only reason I'm here is because my wife thinks I got a problem with smoking I've been smoking all my life and six months ago she thought she got in this health kick right and now everyone who smokes is evil and so that's why I'm here just to please her get her off my back \nT:\tand so you're not too happy to be here this is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon \nC:\tyeah that's an understatement I mean I'm supposed to be at work right now - \nT:\tall right so I can time off you it's costing you time and money \nC:\tyeah I'm only here because my wife forced me to come you know like this has come to a head six months so just nagging me relentless every day because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit \nT:\tso let me ask you this Bob what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?\nC:\twell she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about secondhand smoke and \nT:\tWow that she's been showing you and making you read \nC:\tyeah I got to read this that's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go and have we used to go and have a cigarette together at the table now I have to go outside in this weather you know what's that about and she's to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than thou\nT:\tso you're pretty angry about it it's pretty aging that you're forced to change your whole life \nC:\tbecause of a decision she made six months and she's got my kids on this against you know my son and my daughter there I would it's like they're ganging up on me you know what I mean \nT:\tso from your perspective do you see any consequences to your smoking\nC:\twell the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and I in the family but like my dad's  he still smokes I mean yeah you know sometimes I thought of quitting but I mean I don't I don't know if I can guy I don't I can quit \nT:\tso let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario because there's a lot of pieces to it your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too so you're sort of isolated you're put in a corner you're being told this is something you have to do you have no choice in the matter well you have a few concerns about your health but that's not really the driving force it sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore does that pretty much sum up?\nC:\tyeah yeah I just I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you that you would do anything well yeah I mean we've been married over  years and we've never had any major problems like this is a writ this is the first problem I don't even really see it's a problem because we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside and but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned like if this keeps going on like so it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it \nT:\tit's like it's all or nothing either you keep smoking the way you are things continue to go downhill and get worse your wife gets more and more on your case or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again it's almost like one or the other it's tries to be that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking so I can actually do it that way like gradual taper there are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt recognizing that it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be\nC:\tI wish my wife could have come today because she feels I have to like just stop Rick right away so do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message \nT:\tif you wanted to bring your wife along I'd be more than happy to talk both of you okay I hope the doctors work because their schedule changes from week to week so you work shift so I'll call you back tomorrow set something up\nC:\tokay that sounds good all right thanks for coming in thanks okay  ",
  "﻿T:\tyes and have you been lately I haven't seen you in a while yeah I mean I've been \nC:\tok oh I've been really busy with school and stuff and like it's just been really stressful if you know I was like the last couple weeks in April it's just there's so much going on like I just I don't know I need a drink \nT:\twhat do you mean when you say you want me to drink like you just let you drag often or it can I ask you about this sir \nC:\tyeah it's I mean it's cool I don't know just like ever since I turned  I've been going out a lot and like I just love it I don't know like I drink like I pretty much only on the weekends I try to keep this weekend's \nT:\tso it sounds like you're saying that um you drink too kind of forget about school and like forget about you know school ending and moving home get some food or summer and everything like that \nC:\tyeah i mean i only drink like thursday friday saturday and sunday so like I guess it doesn't really like do a lot of school but no I mean it's think I've does like I'm really stressed like sometimes I just want to get my mind off of things like I have so much on my mind right now I'm so busy with everything like with school and like my family like my brother's coming here next year and it's just like freaking me out like I'm so stressed with everything I just I don't know how to deal with it without drinking \nT:\thmm um do you do you see like a problem with three king or do you do you think that like do you like does it make you feeling good or bad or like what kind of like effects does it get do to you?\nC:\tI mean I don't really see a huge problem with it like I know that it's probably not good for grades and stuff but like when I go to the bar I feel like wonderful like you should see it like there are so many guys that hit on me like I get so many free drinks and I just love it like I feel like I'm so like I don't know like I feel hot like I feel attractive and like me and my boyfriend go to the bar all the time so like I feel like he likes me better when I'm late I don't know like I just I gotta feel free I'm there like whenever I go out I guess it's just alcohol \nT:\twell well you said earlier that um you know your grades weren't where you want them when you're gonna go stressed out about it um do you think that like alcohol is kind of having a negative effect on that?\nC:\tI mean I guess if you say it that way yeah like when I came into school like when I came here I have four point oh straight out high school I mean like I have a lot of scholarships and stuff and just since ever like I when I turned  I like Lhasa on my scholarships like my gpas like I'm not looks kind of Dara Singh good it's like a  like it went out a lot like last semester and this semester hasn't been much better like like I got kicked out of the Honors College like I don't know I'm on academic probation I don't really like to talk about it I mean it's a little embarrassing but at the same time like drinking just it makes me forget all of it like that's just added stress from school and I'd rather just relieved it with alcohol icic \nT:\tyou're saying um you also mentioned that you know you go to the bar with your boyfriend a lot do you think that there's any alternative things you guys can do together like possibly like go to the library and son together or you know just kind of have like i annoy you to stay in on the weekends instead of going out \nC:\tI mean yeah I guess we could we could do that we could study but drinking just makes me feel so good and like I know he loves it like he always wants to go out with me too so I feel like we just have a better time together in our relationship is stronger over jerking like I mean okay we do fight a lot when I get drunk and I get like a little bit jealous but it's worth it \nT:\tum do you think that there's any changes you would want to make with your drinking or you content with like just drinking you know four days a week every weekend?\nC:\tI mean I don't really want to change like I love drinking I I know it's not good for grades and like and really for relationships but like i just love it like it's my relationship with drinking like it i like jerking thursday or sunday and like sometimes my weeks are so stressful like I have three jobs I go to school I have a boyfriend and like I just need a drink during the day sometimes \nT:\tum how does drinking affect your morals like you like is this I mean if can I ask you like does this run your family or is it something you know that your parents like do and you think is okay or like how does that work \nC:\tI mean no I've never been like any alcoholism or anything in my family like I've never really even seen that like in my life so I guess it's it's I don't know um I just I don't know I feel like it's not a huge problem\nT:\tum you said that you know you weren't raised like that you're do parents do you think your parents would like if they knew you drank this much?\nC:\tto me that they would like it and support it or no I would never tell my parents I drink this much like I know you like asking about my morals and stuff like when I was little like my parents raised me like super conservative like I was never allowed to like hang out with the boys and like I always had to like dress appropriately and like do everything but like when I drink like I can do whatever I want like I love it like I mean yeah my girls kind of go down the drain my guy use aren't really there anymore but like I don't know it's alcoholic I just feel it feel great but people think I'm great it's just I feel excited \nT:\tum do you think you've used to lived at home when your parents thinking about this like it's something with their degree precautions like you'd be kicked out or baby Madi you?\nC:\tyeah I mean honestly like I probably try to hide it from my parents but if they ever found out they wouldn't let me say there there's no way\nT:\tum so on a scale of one to ten how likely do you think you could like make this change if you're willing to?\nC:\tof course probably like a for like maybe of five but like honestly right now I don't think I need to make a change like I don't know I just I feel like my life is fine like i'll work on my grades grades are important but i'll graduate eventually like I just I don't know right now like I'm in college when I have a good time like I want a drink well that's great on these a year to four or five and not it is zero or one because \nT:\tit sounds like you're definitely some what motivated to you know getting to getting to you know improve drinking have you ever considered possibly drinking me they like once on the weekend instead of like four times or maybe even limiting to like two or three let me just something like that four times a week ?\nC:\tyeah I thought about it but like I guess I've never really had a reason to do that like my life is fine like I can focus on stuff with alcohol sometimes alcohol makes me study better like I think that right now I'm locator I'm at eventually I guess I could work anyway down but i mean i'll probably grow out of it or anything \nT:\tso it sounds like you're saying that alcohol brings pot of both positive and negative aspects to your life um what do you think that there's more of more positive or negative \nC:\thonestly like probably more positive I mean like I said like like I feel better about myself I look better like in my own eyes I know my boyfriend likes it better unlike he's drunk and when i'm joined together like ever met the bar who buys me drinks like I just I feel so much better about like everything in my life \nT:\tum have ou think about the counseling center here in the university?\nC:\tI don't feel like know anything about it \nT:\tor if you're talking like an advisor about like your grades and they've ever like and you said you lost your scholarships?\nC:\tyeah i mean like last semesters the first mr. I've ever like go to an advisor I always kept them on my own and I went to the Assizes they like weren't happy at all they told me he's like step it off and get my great together I need to work harder in all my classes and I was going to be in forever and I'm just like you know what like I don't know what I do need to work with my great-aunts bullet I mean I didn't know \nT:\tyou could like talk to them about like other stuff like you could talk to them about alcohol um I mean I'm sure that if you had I'm like that like and if they couldn't answer your question necessarily probably would direct you to someone who like could like maybe like a psychologist or someone on campus like a counselor like I said before effort has a Counseling Center where you know you can just go in and talk to someone who you know it was more about like alcohol like people that drink and stuff like that and like how to handle your problems if you're interested I I do have a number but it up to you know \nC:\tI mean yeah i guess i'd appreciate that like i mean nothing has really happened so far making change with my ways but i guess i could take the number \nT:\tum what you said so you said that you're like a  what do you think it would take for you to get on like a nine or  look what do you think would really change your views on this \nC:\tI mean like probably my brother like i tol she's coming here next year and like he means the world to me and like honestly like if something ever happened to him because of alcohol like I would stop like the cold turkey I would have to because like he's my like everything he's my little brother and like I don't know like back in my hometown like drugs were like a big thing and like a lot of people like with died because of drugs with my best friend's boyfriend died because of drugs in like if something ever happened to my boyfriend because alcohol like I would stop because I've seen it with other things but alcohol just never seemed like a threat to me like it never seemed like it could hurt and once I guess if it did I would give me a reason to like\nT:\tum have you ever thought that maybe next year my brother does come that a friend that you know the things you do is like it will reflect back on Hamlin kilowatt to start maybe thinking about drinking and you know kind of like following your footsteps if he sees you out at the bars\nC:\tI mean yeah like when he came here to visit and softly like asked me like if I take it too far and I guess I give the back of my mind I always thought like okay he's  i probably shouldn't take in there but like I took him anyway and it's like I guess if he just like follows in my footsteps and like does everything i do i like would be happy with him like I don't even get in trouble like especially because he's so young like I don't have to think it's okay dit to drink all the time and like not do in school \nT:\tso that sounds like you're saying that you can't really think if you're like talking about all this you kind of feel like alcohols brought you to more of a negative aspect of your life now that you're considering like your brother and stuff like you putting aside you know the bars and how you feel and your boyfriend \nC:\tI mean yeah now that I kind of like have actually thought about it because I never really thought that ever was a problem like I guess it's true like there are negative effects and there's bad things that are happening my life like I guess could be like a tribute it's alcohol and I don't want that to happen anyone else I don't want that to happen my brother I'm like I don't know I I guess it just makes me feel so good that sometimes like I don't know like when is a good time to stop or like how they know the Counseling Center be like well they really help me like I don't know like a delight\nT:\tI mean the Counseling Center does offer people it's I mean just it's kind of like what you make of it like if you're willing to kind of go in there and hear what they have to say then a minute there's maybe more advice and probably like statistics that I obviously can't provide um but yeah so if you're will I knew that phone number um but is do Casey yourself improving like do you do you like can you give me an answer as to like how you can improve like do you think you could go down only three days a week at or two or you good for daddy at four?\nC:\tI mean maybe not right away but I guess eventually like I could go down to like three I don't know about to that seems a little bit drastic but like I guess I can try to cut it out my study or some things that it would just be kind of hard \nT:\twell that's great that you say that you can cut back to three because honestly on you know little by little like improvements occur like you know you if you say you can do three now who knows in a couple months maybe come back to two or even one or I mean even if you have to stay at three for a while that's fine too \nC:\tyeah I

  "﻿T:\tso Rose thank you for coming in today can you just start off I tell me a little bit about yourself\nC:\toh yeah i'm a student right now at U of L will not right now i'm taking a little break from school um i live at home with my parents and I I work out I mean right now I'm not doing too much but on college \nT:\tit's your typical college student \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twell it sounds like you're really really happy about your life I can tell with your facial expressions and things like that you seem pretty content to be taking a little bit of time off from school right now and you know that you live with your parents sounds like you really enjoy spending time based off what you're what you're telling me \nC:\toh not really I do like my family a lot but i kinda want to be back at school I mean I guess I'm kind of friendly person um but yeah I don't know I like starting out of my family for sure I always like to call you home for Christmas and summer break all that kind of stuff but I'm kind of aggravated because here I am my junior year i'm really excited as it gets missing year and graduate and now i have to take another semester because i had to take out this one and I'm really grateful that my parents are like you know letting a little bit them but they are making me look at the same time um so yeah I I got sick a little bit and they asked me to come home and I thought that you know I can get better and i I just I don't want to take any more time off really I want to stick to my age and a graduate on time like everyone else my age so it's aggravating I that I am grateful that I have a family like them I guess \nT:\tso it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tkind of pulling out of school was causing you fall behind what you would like to be \nC:\tyeah i mean everyone gets sick i mean i don't think it's important for me to stay home for that reason you know they may to always be concerned about my health I feel like I think they're a little overly concerned \nT:\tcan you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by sick what kind of symptoms and you have what did that lead to \nC:\twell I just kind of always been more easily able to like colds and stuff and it always kind of got worse for some reason for me i'm not sure why but I you know I just it just kind of happened and so I expected it when I got to college of living has lots of random people in dorms and I knew they'd be like freaking out on it and they of course were finally by sophomore year and it wasn't getting too too sick you know I guess some days at work a couple days of school you know every other month or something but junior year I don't know I guess they thought I was getting more stressed dollars I don't know I'm kind of guessing here but um yeah so my symptoms i guess like you asked we're kind of getting the common cold i guess but i would just get really exhausted and sometimes like everyone so i won't be able to get out of bed but \nT:\tso it sounds like you're really confused about why your symptoms even began \nC:\tyeah i mean just I feel like I'm a pretty normal \nT:\tI know that you really discuss that working out was it really important part of your life it's safe it can you tell me a little bit more about that?\nC:\twell I want to be a personal trainer that's kind of where I am right now like that's why I wanted to stay on my agenda because after school I have to do like a few more years of school getting my masters I'm really excited about that like I mean I've been reading like magazines for training like since I could remember and it's all about you know being fit and being excited about being fit and having like I energy that kind of stuff which is hard when I'm sick time high energy but I always going to work on my own fitness lifting weights and running and doing extra classes just to kind of build my core that kind of stuff so you know I I think that's kind of why or got so much it's really important to me and one day I'm gonna have to encourage you with the workout so I need me they'll love it myself so \nT:\twell def don't want to be hearing that is this this is probably one of the biggest parts of your life and you know what you're saying and I don't even frustrated but you've been unable to do this inject home \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tbecause of the illness and your parents concerns you know you express that you really like to work out every single day how many hours a day on average would you say that you work out?\nC:\tI mean they encourage like what I read is like four arms but like I really want to be a great trainers I'm you like five or six so I know it seems like it I'm like\nT:\tyou're like time consuming it is \nC:\tyeah I mean I like a friend come running with me around smile but a sort of certain point they don't want to keep running with me or like workout me good so you're not a little socializing but I mean it's what we want to do with my life so I have to get used to it one day i'll be doing it for like  hours a day\nT:\tso well it seems to give a lot going on with your life I mean taking that amount of time during a day to run I know it would be very exhausting so I can completely understand that getting the cold may seem pretty doable to you I know that you were referred here by your primary care physician dr. hafer and I know that your parents were just really concerned with not only the amount of exercise that you were doing that maybe also some of your other eating habits yo Mike us try to talk about tonight you can't be a little bit why you think that they're concerned about that at all?\nC:\tI mean compared to like my siblings on Michael little thinner so I guess that's probably what they're thinking but I need a workout I want to be fit but I I really watch what I eat you know I mean that's what they disease I'm een and you know I'm not just magazines for more than that it's Boca soon yeah videos and come on part of many blogs and that kind of stuff you know what I hotel my own but you know they just really encourage watching \nT:\thow much fruit you have how much about how many vegetables you have how many you know how much mean you have?\nC:\tand so my parents had concern when I have very little meat and when I'm you know when I'm just consuming fruits and vegetables so that's really where they're concerned I guess they want that's must be what it is I mean they think I don't consume enough of anything so they tell me but I mean if you look at like these agendas that I have been following other people survive you know by that most the time so I mean so when I guess\nT:\tI'm hear you say is that you're really you're following with the magazines and what the internet what all the other fitness experts are saying right it seems like your parent ships aren't fully understanding that that's just the regimen in the lifestyle that that industry village drives for and they don't follow themselves so \nC:\tI mean they're not going to understand that they've never been really concerned about it I've always kind of encourage them to kind of comment down the heat but you know it's something that yeah I've read these things I and I want to be competitive one day as a trainer and getting other people to be competitive too so I they think us here original question was what was it again I'm sorry I kept rambling I'm nothing \nT:\tyou're doing fine you can continue on as you were we can sort of his head in the direction of I know you really discussed a lot about fitness and working out as one of your really important aspects of your life will you have some of the other important aspects of your life?\nC:\tum well like i kind of said my family and i really do care about them and so they're very important to me and my schoolwork is very important to me i really try to do well Matt just try to focus my time on that and I also do a couple hours of work everyone everyone's valid during the week at the library so I try to put those hours there just because I need to make the extra money to pay for you know I'll do all the things that I following magazines and my groceries because the campus foods one of the most i joined by our groceries absolutely \nT:\twell it sounds like you are incredibly busy as a college student John sleeping \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tit's something that I think would be very beneficial for the next week before we meet again it's I would like for you to try to do your best to journal kind of document maybe how your day goes you know in the morning what are you doing in the in the afternoon what are you doing it at night time where you're doing just just breathe little notations you know seven o'clock i'm doing this eight o'clock i'm doing this not every single hour but as often as you can remember I'm and I'm likely to bring that in next week for us to discuss that way we can kind of see how your schedule is going around real quick \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tthat sounds like we're going to do for training sometimes \nC:\tgood \nT:\tall right well I'll see you next weekend are good next thing  ",
  "﻿T:\thi William I'm Heather I'm so glad to meet you \nT:\thi Heather thanks for coming in sure how was your trip over \nC:\tit was okay i had trouble finding the place at first\nT:\tbut you know first time coming here you made it I made it right fantastic and it looks like you brought some paperwork with you  C \tand I didn't I filled out the form \nT:\tthank you for all of that how was all that for you it's a lot of papers a lot to fill out \nC:\tI I wasn't sure on some of it what to put down so I'm hoping you'll help me with that \nT:\tfantastic well thanks so much for going through all of that e note was a lot to ask and I'm so glad that you're here and that you made it and we can most certainly go through any of that that would be useful for you today okay and I'm wondering if maybe at first before we get started I'd like to check in with you and just see if there's any questions things that you've been thinking about or wondering about since you first heard about our program that might have brought you here might be on your mind \nC:\tum-hmm that's a good question well I not really I know a little bit about the program actually because I was a client about seven or eight years ago and didn't really things didn't turn out well so I'm interested to know how things might be different and I'm I'm just not sure I'm just not sure with my situation if you can help me out or not \nT:\tsure so you're back with us again and thinking about gosh this time might be different for you and may be wondering what that might look like \nC:\tI hope so yeah yeah \nT:\tanything else that might be on your mind or even thinking about or wandering about?\nC:\twell I have I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself or not but I have a little bit of a record for some misdemeanors when I used to drink and so I'm I just really feel like I'm not good for much I don't know who would want me for it to work \nT:\tso they're really wondering right now if if if work is possible for you\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tdo you think it is well I hope that through our work together you'll be able to decide that for yourself hmm and my hope in our process is that that we could be partners and thinking about that together and what what work might look like for you in your life and how it might fit in for you how does that sound \nC:\tokay I thought you might just tell me what to do and I had to do it I'm so this okay I'm I'm ready like I can do that \nT:\tso thinking about for yourself what you know could be possible is almost a new thought for you right now \nC:\tit is usually when I'm at home I'm pretty depressed and thinking this is the rest of my life and it's not something I'm it just doesn't make me happy when I think of it like that so to think there might be alternatives or choices interesting i'm not sure what to do with that\nT:\thonestly and something brought you here today it did \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twhat was it that made you decide even with all of that sort of thinking about at home?\nC:\ti'm not sure if this is possible or this this may not work out for me \nT:\tand yet there was something that brought you here \nC:\twell I consider my chair all day and watch TV shows I get to watch the old days and its really nostalgic and I'm in my mid  so I'm thinking I could be doing this for another  or  years is that really okay for me my son is he's an adult he still lives with me but he's he's capable taking care of himself and I just can't imagine myself sitting in this chair for the next  years and just deteriorating and I don't think I would last  years i think i would ask maybe eight and I'm not ready to go \nT:\tso there was a moment in time when you were sitting in your chair watching your oldies that you thought is this what the rest of my life will be like em hmm will there be something you know that be something more and also you know it's part of the time it's like yeah this is it you know you made your bed be happy with it and this is this is all there is in that's it then this other part is not too sure if that's okay \nC:\tyou know I'm not really sure I want to be there yeah not as comfortable but then the end then there's a third voice that says he can't do anything and so it's just like I just feel really confused and kind of tied up in knots and I thought well I'll give you our try again it can't hurt I might get mad but why not \nT:\twell I'm really glad you're here William and I look forward to finding out much more about what it is that's most important to you and what you want your life to be like in it in the future and you do know what's best for yourself you have those voices that you said that tell you what you do like and what works for you and and the voice that sort of says I'm not sure that this is what's best for me you have a lot of things kind of rolling around in your \nC:\tI do it's an just spins around in there it's really really hard sometimes yeah how exhausting that must feel mmhmm yeah and confusing and aggravating and depressing and anxiety-provoking and just all of that honestly it was kind of hard to come in here because I just like I'm feeling kind of hopeless about the whole situation so um but I like I said I just thought I can't hurt and even just talking about it in this moment\nT:\tI noticed that you got a little tense and sort of it's almost like those wheels are turning again just considering it as the coaches are tracking \nC:\tit is I just think I'm i don't know i feel kind of dumb it's just like what am i what do i think i'm doing but i'll try not to be negative i'll try to think more positive it's just kind of a habit \nT:\tI guess and you have some hope for your future that things can be different for you I hope so I'm sure what that looks like yet don't know what it looks like \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tso what do you think if the two of us together um could potentially start exploring that journey a little bit some of the things you mentioned just in our brief interaction right now have been that you that you have a son that lives with you that is really doing okay and so you're able to start thinking about yourself in your life and that maybe you're a little concerned about what the future might bring and what some of the things in your life that you're dealing with your criminal history for instance might potentially get in your way and how could you how could you get around that what life could you have for yourself at home it's more than sitting in that easy chair watching your oldies mhm so if we may be delved into a bit more of that sort of what you're thinking about working how does \nC:\tthat sound sounds really good I I haven't worked for  years and or maybe eight but it's been a long time and things have changed so much I just know it won't be easy but I'm ready for that you seem like a pretty nice person to talk to so I'll give it a try \nT:\tyou're ready to at least explore it huh so um would this be a good time for me to share a little bit maybe about how our program might have changed from the last time \nC:\tsure I'd yes please \nT:\tso how I see things is that I sort of feel like maybe a guide or a partner with you in your journey towards work in thinking about work from where you are now maybe feeling a little bit confused or not sure about what the future may bring and then to bringing you forward to however that looks for you in your life and hopefully to that place where you really want to be where you're doing something that that fits for you and feels good and that we it as a program have some resources that we could potentially utilize together our first step would be of course today to take your application for services and then after that I would be able to look at whether or not you're eligible to work together on this journey and if so we would be able to figure that out together what that path looks like so how does that sound to you?\nC:\tit sounds pretty good I'm how long does this take \nT:\tthat's a great question so you really you really want to know what the path forward might look like yeah what to expect what to expect \nC:\tyeah I really like to know what to expect that's important to me and everyone's journey is different working \nT:\toh you and I together can potentially plan that mm-hmm we can talk about there are certainly certain time frames in our program around eligibility our first step is the application and then we have some time frames and together our hope is that we can even improve on those time frame um so I guess it's kind of a wait and see well know when it happens how long it takes absolutely but the first step is just to get started and how about if we along the way maybe kind of check in with each other around expectations and time frames would that be useful?\nC:\thmm mm-hmm thanks \nT:\tyeah yeah totally so if you'd like to get started would you mind if I take a look at your application paperwork and just make sure that there isn't anything that I may have a question about \nC:\tokay thank you very much for bringing fun like I said I  ",
  "﻿T:\tWilliam it's really nice to see you back again \nC:\thi yeah I'm glad you're here and as I know as I had mentioned on the phone when I set up the time that you have we have found that you're eligible to or the services here and so that means that we can get started and really map out a plan okay and our guidelines are that we need to we need to have we have  days to develop that plan and there's a lot of different ways that we can go about it and think about it and will kind of start that process today how does that say? \nC:\tokay yeah sounds good\nT:\tum in before we get started on the specifics of this I'm wondering if there's anything that you're concerned about today or things that you've been thinking about in relationship to that?\nC:\tOh since our last meeting you know it was really interesting because part of the time I was really enthused and part of the time I was really scared and I started just kind of throwing around ideas and but at the same time one thing we didn't really talk about too much last time was some of the this I've got some pain of my ankle my car doesn't always work my son has a mental illness and I hate to say this but I I for the pain i use medical marijuana and so i just wanted to be upfront and honest with that \nT:\tyeah so there's a few other things \nC:\tbut you know just that things are still spinning in my head \nT:\tyeah so that you've been thinking about it a lot and about some of the issues that may come up and actually I what I what I put together here is in looking at your paperwork I kind of pulled out some of the things that are possible for us to talk about and I you had indicated on there that you had medical marijuana so I've got that I walk the whole issue with the pain okay on there it does sound like the that thinking about dealing with your son might be an important one for us to consider in this too \nC:\tmm-hmm it is he has his ups and down for sure mm-hmm create a lot of stress so yeah right and makes it up makes it hard to think about being able to take care of that and and go out and do other things too \nT:\tyeah you know you mentioned in your in the paperwork that what you you wanted some help sort of thinking through a work goal or the possibility of work at all \nC:\tyeah like that's it's just like making that decision and really working on it the when I went through also I pulled out a few things and here's what i came up with from that\nT:\tand you mentioned last time about the criminal history that you had a little bit of concern about the misdemeanors were there that were there you also have talked about in your that you were on the SSDI and that you had you know for your for the injury based on your injury and the disability and sort of thinking about maybe some benefits thinking about that in relationship to work and has another thing we could discuss so another thing that was on there was the education and you mentioned about the not having a GED or finishing up high school and that's certainly something we can talk about and how that might affect work you mentioned the that there had been some issues with alcohol addiction and certainly that is a topic that we could talk about and how that might you know might play in with the work and then the pain management and the sort of follow-up to the injury and what what that is what that is or what concerns you have about that and as you just mentioned you the issue with your son and how what your role in taking care of him or how much that puts on the family stress mhm and all of those are areas that we could start with and I'm also wondering if there's something that you feel is more important to start with in terms of initiating this journey towards figuring out what your goal is \nC:\twell one thing that's really big on my mind and maybe it's wrapped up in here is that all the work I've done was physical labor work and I can't do that anymore so there's been a whole shift and so I'm feeling really sort of lost about what what's of it what are the odds available i don't even know with physical work there's a ton of things that a person can do \nT:\tyeah \nC:\tand i just can't do that \nT:\tso that's certainly possibly the exploration of what kinds of work that aren't that aren't physical in nature recognizing that you wouldn't be able to do the kind of work that you did previously bright and really thinking about that and certainly there's some resources that we have for helping in that exploration and looking at there are a lot there are other options out there are ya okay for someone my age you think?\nC:\tyes okay yeah I do \nT:\tit's just learning more about that\nC:\tyeah okay looking through them so okay you know and what I want to say is we can end up touching on we may possibly end up touching on all of these things during the course of our our planning process and it's really about figuring out what is the most important thing to you to start with and what you have the most concerns about or what you think would help you most in that decision-making process what do you think well all of this \nC:\tyeah you're right it all plays a part but I gotta say this pain that I have in my ankle is constant it's always there and it's just sometimes it's worse than other times but it affects my sleep it affects my outlook and then I use some marijuana to help kind of ease that the severity of that pain but the pain is still there so it you know I can get up and think my day is planned this way or this way and I may not be able to get past that that lounger the recliner man to be because of that pain and I'm so I've that really scares me is that going to keep me from working and i don't know if i told you but I've got like nails and and plates are not nails with screws and plates in my ankle and have to use a cane and people are going to notice right off the bat when they see me that there's something wrong with this guy \nT:\tand so it's already it's pretty obvious and it also sounds like that pain is really taken up a pretty big role in your in your life and it feels like a pretty big barrier right there\nC:\tsometimes it's all I can think about\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tis that playing yeah \nT:\twell how about we spend some time really talking about what what that pain management might look like what what you've been doing and and sort of how you see that playing out in your work that be that's not okay?\nC:\tdefinitely \nT:\ttell me you mentioned the marijuana and you mentioned that you um that you know that you have a cane and have some adaptations and tell me what else you're sort of doing to manage the pain right now \nC:\twell like the other day I tripped and I did something to my ankle I don't know exactly what but I have a like a boot you know and somebody hurts your ankle they can put a big boot on it so I've got a boot that helps keep it stable I've also got a brace that helps keep it stable it's hard sometimes one of the wound might open up and become infected so then there's doctors appointments and that kind of pain and it's not very pretty what else have I been doing just not I try not to overdo it but sometimes that's kind of hard because I tend to push myself sometimes i take i don't take any of the heavy duty meds i've had addiction in the past i know and they don't make me feel good anyway so that's a good thing I'm not hooked on some of those really heavy-duty prescription medication so I will take over-the-counter ibuprofen and tylenol things like that I think that's about all I can't think of anything else yeah you know I just do \nT:\tI want to affirm how much you know about yourself that you made decisions about how manage this based on not wanting to get yourself in trouble with addiction again?\nC:\tI I really that's a you know I really takes a lot of courage to do that and to sort of live with the pain and figure out alternatives well I always tell people I one drink away from jail so you know that's a pretty good deterrent \nT:\tyeah yeah so that stays at the kind of the forefront to the top of your head to like oh boy and if the stress gets too much that could be a problem \nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tit's true yeah you know one thing it sounds like the pain management is probably the place where might be useful to start because that might be the most the right up front the thing place to start so we can do that and we can talk about there are alternatives out there and and different programs and different situations that have been useful for others in your situation in terms of managing pain so maybe we will send me to a shrink maybe they'll shrink that ankle \nC:\tyeah i just know he'll say it's all in my head sometimes \nT:\tand so it sounds like you've had some experience that \nC:\toh I'm being told that it's it's just in your head and it's really that really makes me mad \nT:\tyeah because you really know you know what it is and you've been living with it and working with it and trying to find a way to manage it for a long time \nC:\texactly yeah\nT:\tright don't want somebody telling you\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tthat you're making it up \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twell I can assure well that that we that we can find alternatives to that\nC:\tokay I'll be curious about that \nT:\tyeah okay well how about we go ahead and set that up and we'll start there and we'll keep these others and what I want to let you know is that if other things come up that we need to cover we can put them on this list to to make sure we'll check in about these okay it's time we meet and figure out what if you know where what we want to work on that day okay start with the pain \nC:\tokay sounds great thank you \nT:\tmm-hmm  ",
  "﻿T:\twondering if you would be willing to share with me what you picked \nC:\tok I'd be glad to and I just have to say it was really hard to choose the top three and I actually stuck in a fourth \nT:\tit's important to you there is a lot \nC:\tthat's important to me and I am \nT:\tlet's see do they seem to be in order when I tell you about them? or just however you'd like to start \nC:\tokay \nT:\tum wanting to start with family and it says to have a happy loving family \nC:\tI'm going to kind of family is very important to me having a happy loving family that is kind of a it would be a nice goal but a family that's that gets along well a family that is there for each other and support each other maybe not always happy and loving but you know still there for each other that's really important to me \nT:\tit's a really a family that is kind of your rock and he family is very different than maybe the words that are on this card and yet family really called out to you family did you know that's basically the only people \nC:\ti talked with two is why one friend that comes over once in a while but really all during the week and its family so I don't know you know where I would be without them and and it's just so it kind of blends in with us next on the responsibility I Myers my ability to be responsible has increased so much when it comes to family and I really want to keep that going I I feel like I have a I have to prove something to my family that because I wasn't responsible for a long time and in fact I still have plenty of times I'm not responsible but it's other you know I try I'm trying my best to show that I can be responsible does that make sense?\nT:\tso family and responsibilities are tied together for you and responsibility is something that you haven't always been as you would like and yet you've grown in your ability to be responsible possibly partly because of your family \nC:\twell especially with my son he started working so I'm there to take him to work and pick him up so that kind of gets me going during the day whenever we have a family gathering I'm always the first one there and I used to be the last one and so I try to be really punctual and be there for my family when I can i really think i'm kind of the black sheep of the family though i'm not i'm not really worth it a lot so maybe I this is why this is kind of hard because it's almost as if I'm going over and above just to make a point that I'm responsible and then sometimes I just feel like I'm not responsible to anyway I'm just talking in circles \nT:\tso sometimes how they interact with you you don't always feel what you're trying to show them \nC:\tor I don't always know that what I'm yeah I don't know what they're thinking about me so I tend to make things up \nT:\tyeah and because of what you're thinking you sometimes then really try to act responsible and hope that they will be able to see what you're trying to show \nC:\tya want them to accept me more because I just felt I haven't been all that accepted \nT:\tand you keep trying \nC:\tI do I do yep \nT:\tyeah so this is do these really fit together for you so tell me about the others that you pay\nC:\tso i picked cleanliness it's real important to me because like i said before i am i pretty much in my chair watching TV a lot of the time or on the internet or something however it's i don't want to sit in my house all day and have it be a stinking mess with garbage all over the place so I'm a little bit sort of OCD about that you might say I have to have make sure every surface is clean all the time and I vacuumed once a day even though it really hurts on my ankle I get up on a vacuum I have a cat so I make sure the cat box is scooped and if anyone comes over my place is always it's immaculate and I take a lot of pride in that \nT:\tyeah so it gives you pride to be able to show something you are able to do even it's even if it's sometimes difficult '\nC:\tmm-hmm sometimes I wonder if I go overboard but you know that's okay it's my house right I can do what I want and you feel good about it \nT:\tyou said I do you feel pride mm-hmm I do you know you dirty a dish you clean it and put it away that's that's what you do and if it's difficult and others notice \nC:\tmmhmm yeah I've had family come over every so often and they're like wow this place is amazing it's spotless so yeah I feel good about that \nT:\tso you mentioned that somehow that also connects with family it's not only for yourself it's also sometimes for others possibly being able to show them that you're responsible in your own dwelling in what you're able \nC:\ti am and even though i only get twelve hundred dollars a month or  or something in social security my rent is about  you know I barely can make ends meet I have to sell things all the time I have a clean house I'm proud of and I do what I say if I tell family I'll do it and I want the best for my son who has had lots of rough times so may I never thought about like that before \nT:\tyour boy true changes us when you start talking about the right that you have and what you're able to do with what you feel like might not be a lot \nC:\tyeah I was kind of defiant you know some people wouldn't be able to get by as well as I've been able to I think so and then I had that humor because I think I'm really funny and creative and it's important that's really important to me to keep that perspective and to keep that kind of at the forefront or else i could just sink into a deep dark hole that side of you oh \nT:\tso in thinking about family responsibilities and cleanliness there's that sense of pride of something bigger than yourself and you're really working hard here and yet you've got this this hammer that sort of fits in there with all of that no tell me more about how you see humor fitting in in your life with all of these things that seem to be so almost serious mmm really focused well and understand \nC:\ti'm thinking about work along all this time too so because of my creativity and my family tells me i created more that i say i'm creative but my family tells me i'm creative and i we play games okay so i don't know if\nT:\tyou've seen this game but it's some draw it's like words of friends but you draw pictures and you have the other person \nC:\ti guess what it is it's not easy to draw a picture on an iPad because of the the stylus makes such big lines but boy I can draw some really cool pictures on there and my family takes screenshots and they keep them because they're so cool and then later they'll they'll show them to me and I'll be like wow I really did that so the humor is that they're kind of funny some of them like one of Elvis it was really funny and I just felt like the family you know gave me special record gives me special recognition sometimes they really noticed they notice that have this special ability\nT:\tmm-hmm and it touches them in a way that you want to touch them \nC:\thmm I'm not sure what I could do with that but you know and same with humor just ice I kind of see things from my ionic perspective the and I can't even give you an example right now but I just I just think of really funny things when they pop out of my mouth and and I give I get positive recognition from my family that way \nT:\tso you really have a connection with your family through the actions that you take in your life to show them that you're a responsible person and these relationships with her family are really central to your life right now they are the people that you interact most with and you have pride in yourself so that respect of yourself and being able to show your family what you're really able to do in your life how you're able to keep things clean and presentable and have that sense of pride and yet it seems that your humor and creativity is something that really is almost a more powerful thing in being able to show who you are and getting special recognition for in your life who you are as a person and maybe a part of you that you have yet to fully discover or to show the world who you can be what do you think of all that feels pretty good\nC:\tI'm a little embarrassed \nT:\tyeah hmm so haven't really thought of yourself in that way\nC:\tI'm usually more negative about myself huh I've got more going for me than I thought this is the best of\nT:\tWilliam mm-hmm han couldn't couldn't keep it here this this is important to you this humor the humor yeah keeps me going that creativity yeah keeps me going it's almost like that that light ahead that hope that you were talking about \nC:\toh yeah yeah \nT:\tI don't think some people realize how important humor and their life is and it's very very important to me clearly as you see the path ahead and thinking about work and I know you mentioned that when you were considering your values you were thinking about work at that time \nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\thow if at all do you see possibly utilizing these core values family responsibilities cleanliness and humor in thinking about what your life could be like with work it work?\nC:\thuh well right off the bat I thought of crime analyst because most work environments you know they want you to keep your workspace clean I have to tell you I had a job a long time ago and I was driving around and I would spit sunflower seeds out and just made a mess on my truck and my boss didn't like that I was young I didn't know what the big deal was but now that I'm older it's like \nT:\tokay that's a really important a site to bring through the workplaces having a clean workspace or being like remembering that cleanliness is important in the workplace being a good work partner \nC:\tyeah right because other people don't want to be tripping on on my clutter and \nT:\tof course responsibility because if your employee there's always that expectation that you'll do what is asked of you or that you'll do what you say you'll do and you know you can do that right \nC:\tyeah I think I can and I'm not exactly sure about family but humor when I think of humor and working I think of getting along with coworkers and you know that's that's an important aspect to work to is being able to get along with others and I can do that most of time sometimes I'm not so great at it my humor can be a little bit biting so I might need to watch that sometimes \nT:\tyeah so you really think about others and how they interact with you \nC:\tmm-hmm \nT:\tand who you are as a person that's those are all important things for you \nC:\tit's important for me to know or to have them think highly of me\nT:\twell thank you very much William for taking the time and really thinking about your core values and you mentioned this it was difficult to pick um and you shared a lot about about who you are and and sometimes it may be a little uncomfortable and thinking about those those things that are really most precious to us and I just really wanted to thank you for that opportunity to really get to know you about her and I hope that I hope it was useful for you and that we can use it together in our work figuring out what the path ahead might look like he'll work in your life how can I remember these what do you think when you when there are things that you want to remember in your life how does it work for you how do you typically remember things I think I need to write it down so i'll write it on a piece of paper \nC:\tsure \nT:\tkeep it with me \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyeah something that you can maybe take no doubt \nC:\tmm-hmm \nT:\thow do you think you might use it?\nC:\twell that's a good question Oh ideally when I'm in a situation where I think I'm not getting along well or if I think things aren't going so great just in general or I'm really thinking negative about self is when I could pull it out and look at it and get a reminder so that's something I'll have to keep in mind i'm not sure how much i'll do it but i'll at least it's there and it's a start \nT:\tit's interesting to consider who it might be something as a reminder to yourself about what a really responsible person and that humor is also important to you\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tthose things that are most important the guiding principles in your life \nC:\tyeah yeah  ",

  "﻿T:\tHi Emmy. I'm Denise.\nC:\tHi.\nT:\tI'm one of the advocates here at the center.\nC:\tNice to meet you.\nT:\tAnd how are you? How are you today?\nC:\tI'm fine. Thanks. Well, strange, feeling strange for this but okay.\nT:\tYeah it's something really different for you?\nC:\tMm-mm. I have, I have not done this before.\nT:\tWell why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today.\nC:\tI'm not even sure. I I heard, about this place and that you work with women who are, having trouble with their relationship and are confused and so, I thought I'd give you guys a call. And so, I'm, thank you so much for taking the time to see me.\nT:\tYeah. So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what, what my role might be today\nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tYeah. \nC:\tYeah. Cuz I don't know what to do.\nT:\tYeah. What I want to reassure you of is that i'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or any information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you. Just sorta sort out what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So, this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today. How does that sound?\nC:\tThat sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself.\nT:\tYeah, so right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on and you're not even sure where to start.\nC:\tYeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. I have a little baby at home, so I don't, I can't think, anyway most of the time.\nT:\tYeah. So now anything, any kind of decisions you make or anything that you do, effects both you and the, and the baby.\nC:\tHuh, uh-huh. And, and my, boyfriend. It, it affects him. Which is why I guess I'm here, is to talking about him and me and the baby and how we work together.\nT:\tYeah. Well, if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?\nC:\tI don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we, just had this baby a little while ago. And, and before that I was working and, he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there. We, we get in fights and he disappears for a while and then he comes back. That's kind of what the years look like. And I've just been getting more and more confused on what to do, and recently I did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person, and it freaked me out. And it freaked the baby out. And, quite honestly, it freaked him out, too. He didn't, he said he, he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.\nT:\tSo the, in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way. And that there have been some incidents where you've had some arguments and separated for awhile and gotten back together.\nC:\tUh-huh.\nT:\tIt does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of  Freaked everybody out.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tAnd all, all of you. The baby and you and him and, and was kinda scary.\nC:\tMm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah. He, he came home. I was, a friend had come over, a, a man friend. He doesn't like me to have men friends. He came over to help me with my resume. Cuz I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as, right after he left, he he kinda just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever has happened to me or to us together and. It, he just got this weird kinda like he was possessed by something and he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He is such, he is a really good daddy and he really helps us out a lot.\nT:\tSo in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand he's really good, good with you, and good with the father, I mean good with your child, and on the other hand it was like what is this? Something really different.\nC:\tMm-hm, mm-hm, yeah and he's, he's he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to, to do with that. So that's why, that's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do.\nT:\tWhat, what are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do, if, if anything? What are, what are you thinking about?\nC:\tI haven't talked to anybody for a year, really.\nT:\tYou've gotten pretty isolated.\nC:\tYeah. Yeah, I haven't. My parents live pretty far away, and, I guess he's kind of, my boyfriend's kind of I guess the word's jealous. He just really cares about us.\nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tAnd so I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that wha, what could I do? I used to work, and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sorta made it clear that, that I don't need to work because he's gonna take care of us. He brings home diapers.\nT:\tMm-hm.\nC:\tAnd gives us some money when he's around. And so, we really don't need it most of the time.\nT:\tMm-hm. So you had been kinda thinking about maybe going back to work and doing, doing some of that on your, on your own. And, and yet he, he doesn't really, he's expressing that he'd like to be able to take care of you and- \nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tAnd when he's there he, he does take care of you?\nC:\tYeah, yeah. And yeah he does take care of us. He's a, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, for the basic needs in the house, and he pays the rent, and you know, but when I, when he's gone and I run out of money, it just kind of, that's when I think, God I just wish I could take, do a little bit by myself, I'm just not sure.\nT:\tYeah, yeah.\nC:\tHow to go about doing that.\nT:\tYeah, because that leaves you in a real bind, when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need.\nC:\tMm-hm, mm-hm, and I, yeah, and I don't know who to talk to about that.\nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tI try to call him sometimes, and make up. You know, and say sorry for the fight that we had. And sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.\nT:\tYeah. So you kind of find yourself when you're in that bind trying to find ways of, of getting, getting what you need met, and, yeah.\nC:\tMm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah. So I don't know to do this. I mean I don't know what to do next. I'm not very good at it.\nT:\tI just wanna say we, we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate, how hard this is to be able to talk about it and it's, it's not an easy situation and you're definitely not alone and I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.\nC:\tThanks. It's really hard to.\nT:\tYeah. I know.  There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are, that, that many women in very similar situations find themselves. And things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and figure out what, if anything, that you want to do differently or how to, what your next step might be.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tAnd, and, some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship. You've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's, can be really good and then he can be gone for a while, and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources, about the resources in the community that may be there for you or in terms of your own understanding, but also if you are in need of additional help we can talk about those.\nC:\tOh. \nT:\tWe can talk about safety planning, I mean one of the, one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and, and your baby safe  And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now.\nC:\tMm-hm. \nT:\tWe can certainly explore that a little bit more. Taking care of yourself, which- \nC:\tYeah right.\nT:\tYeah, yeah. For many, many new, new moms, that's hard under any circumstances, to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also, just the whole issue about taking care of your child, and, and your, your mothering, your parenting. How you might, how you might, focus on that and, in this situation.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tOr there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front just to start with.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tWhat do you think?\nC:\tWell, it, it's it's funny, as you're showing me this, I, I've been thinking that all I've been doing is focusing on the baby, and being a good mom, and and, and yet, I'm also trying to think about getting a job, and I don't know how those two, fit together. And even as I'm just saying that out loud, I'm not even talking about taking care of him, which is weird that I'm not even. When I look at this, these circles I, I'm looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important, yet I'm spend, I spend so much time thinking about him all the time. And right now I'm not.\nT:\tMm-hm. So maybe y, y, you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with w, w, what it, where, what it means and where it is.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tAnd now you are kinda think well maybe I oughta think about some other things and see where I might go with those. These things, if, if, a job and taking, learning how to be a better mother and might be might help the relationship so that might be. So it might be a way of focusing on how, how you might be able to take care of yourself. Get, get a job or look at the possibility of doing that, and the same time trying to incorporate your, taking care of your child. Tho, those things might help you and might free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship.  What to do about the relationship.\nC:\tYeah, what to do about the relationship. I'm not sure what to do with the relationship.\nT:\tMm-hm. And, you know, you, you're the only one that, that really will know about that. About the dealing with the relationship. About what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make, one way or the other.\nC:\tI don't even know what to think about that. I don't know how to. \nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tI don't feel like I can make any decisions.\nT:\tYeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas and, and, when you think about. Was that, was that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job. Is that something you'd like to talk about?\nC:\tYeah.And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time cuz that sounds really hard.\nT:\tWell, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work- \nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tWhen, after the baby was born. What, what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that and, and, and thinking about, thinking about that? What have you thought about?\nC:\tWell, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more. He would need to help take care of the baby. He didn't do that now, so I don't know, and it'd be kind of scary, that, I don't know what that would look like. So I would have to find some other help to get, to be able to go to work, even just part time.\nT:\tMm-hm.\nC:\tSo, I've got to get some child care or something.\nT:\tYeah. So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and, and other ways of taking care of the, the baby so that you would be still okay about going back to work.\nC:\tYeah. \nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tYeah. Somebody I trusted.\nT:\tYeah, yeah.\nC:\tAnd I'd have to figure out, just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still, breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure that I'm there for bedtime and all those important times. But make enough money that it was worthwhile to do it.\nT:\tTo, yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds like a lot.\nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tIt really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things, the basic needs, and really taking care of your child at the same time.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tYeah, yeah.\nC:\tIt's very important to me.\nT:\tYeah. \nC:\tI didn't think I was, I wanted to have children and then we did so I would like him to be a daddy in that, wow, just realized I was thinking about him not being around as a daddy and I'm not really sure what to do with that.\nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tBut the babe, the baby is the most important thing right. I didn't realize that, I'd spend so much time thinking about him all the time. And when is he gonna be back and does he love us and why the heck did he do that, that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about.\nT:\tBeing jealous and not wanting you to have friends.\nC:\tYeah, why does he. And it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking about now, which is the baby and, huh.\nT:\tBut it's, you've mentioned that a couple times now that it's, that it sort of surprises you. They way you're thinking about it and the way you're approaching it. Like, you, you're recognizing or seeing that you have spent a lot of time really agonizing over, over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship, or what it really means. You've spent a lot of time there. That kinda surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently.\nC:\tMm-hm, agonizing. I guess that's what I've been doing. I feel like I've just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always. So, when the baby's crying, I'm, I'm worrying about him, and, and and I so the baby crying is, is just, it's hard. But but if, just now talking about it, letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing. That I could actually think about why the baby is crying, as opposed to why is why is he not returning my calls or why did he give me that look when I, you know, talked about getting a job and things like that. It's not, so. Interesting.\nT:\tSo, you're realizing too, how much it really takes to focus attention on the baby and to be able to do it and it's like I, I, I it's hard to do both.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tIt's hard to really think about doing both.\nC:\tI need his help with that.\nT:\tYeah. \nC:\tI don't need to be worrying about him too. I don't understand what safety planning means.\nT:\tWell, one of the things that we, we look at is trying to help people who are in, in a situation similar to you. Where, where there might be some, where there might be some fear about something that could, that might happen, or you know. And I know you said he, he, he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel, to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe if that's what needs to happen. So if he kinda got that weird look in his eye again which, actually, I've seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before.\nC:\tMm-hm. It just went farther this time.\nT:\tYeah, okay so like if I recognize, if I saw that look, what to do? Is that? \nC:\tYeah, \nT:\tyeah and, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know there might be places that you can go to, to get safe. There might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe. Or make sure that the baby's safe. Or people to call, or thing, just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you, what resources you have available to you.\nC:\tMm-hm. \nT:\tIs that something you're interested in really exploring?\nC:\tSounds kinda freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and, you know, loves the baby. Sounds a little strange.\nT:\tMm-hm. Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way.\nC:\tNo, it shouldn't have to be that way. But it, I didn't expect him to do what he did either, so. That kinda came out of nowhere.\nT:\tYeah. It really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where. How does this fit and what, what does it mean?\nC:\tYeah. \nT:\tAnd what do I do with it\nC:\tYeah. \nT:\tHow do I, how do I respond to this\nC:\tYeah. \nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tIt doesn't seem real. So I guess, thinking about, thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time.\nT:\tYeah. Well, let me see if I, if I got it all, and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. And I wanna make sure I, I understand a little bit about your situation.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tAnd, this, first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really, prompted you to, to take some steps. Because it's scared you.\nC:\tMm hm. \nT:\tMm-hm. You have this relationship that's been kinda off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you, meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tAnd, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure. And this is, this incident has also made you kind of think about that.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tSome of the ways that you've been thinking about or, or thinking about it now kind of surprises you. But you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit. So that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself for those times when you need to.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tAnd you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did that kind of get it all?\nC:\tThat, yeah, that kind of captures it all. I'm not yes, yeah. I don't know. I don't know where to start.\nT:\tMm-hm, mm-hm.\nC:\tBut I guess that's why I'm talking to you.\nT:\tYeah, yeah. So, maybe we can, we can take that next step and, and and. When, when, when we get together again and we can do that. We can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those, in both of those areas.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tFor keeping yourself safe. And, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities. Cuz there are options and resources out there should you choose to, to, to make the decision to go back to work.\nC:\tMm-hm.\nT:\tThere are some options for you.\nC:\tSo, there's like a good, somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that?\nT:\tYeah, there, there are other options for, for, for a variety of things and we can make some, have some discussions about that.\nC:\tOkay, okay. \nT:\tHow does that sound?\nC:\tThat sounds good. That'd be nice.\nT:\tWell, I, I really appreciate again your coming in today. And we will follow up with this conversation and in you, you will have,  ",
  "﻿T:\tit's good to see you how are you \nC:\tI'm doing okay yeah you know things have been settling down a bit I think \nT:\tyeah the last time we saw things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharged from the hospital about a week ago \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tyes here how's your injury?\nC:\tit's it's um pretty pain you know had a lot of pain in it I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids\nT:\tand you've been trying to stay \nC:\tbut yeah yeah it's been hard to think about myself when I have so many other things that are more play more important than me to deal with \nT:\thow are your kids doing?\nC:\tthey're doing okay you know the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen but the older the older kids have helped out quite a bit so I think they're pulling together \nT:\tyeah I imagine that there's some you know a period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in it sounds like also just trying to get things done \nC:\tyeah I mean my motto is just to keep moving you know moving as fast as I can I'm trying to give you know keep the house clean and be good you know with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because you know there's nothing they can do about that \nT:\tso you're you're taking care of a lot of people your community your kids all the while trying to take care of yourself that's a lot \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tI really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on yeah well you know last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe and I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about \nC:\tno I you know I made time today to talk about this I think it's really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there and so it's it's I'm looking forward to thinking about what what things I can do see \nT:\tso so you were scared sounds like you were scared it was terrifying \nC:\tI mean we police were called you know we ended up having to call the police him and Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail I had child welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosey and gozman and it's it's it was just very scary so so a lot of things were turned upside down \nT:\tand when you say it was scary I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive \nC:\tright I mean it was you know we had people coming to the house Colin  and you know checking in are you okay or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know it's just too many you know too many cooks in the kitchen \nT:\tso a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing\nC:\tyeah yeah so I'm just really i'm not i'm not going to do that i'm not gonna get a restraining order i'm not going to call the police you know he knows where I live \nT:\tand so say more about that say more about why you why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order?\nC:\tthey were they were throwing him on the ground they were holding his arms behind his back and and they had their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man you never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely so I was I was terrified for him and then the next day you know child welfare call in the house \nT:\tit sounds like that was a very scary experience in moment for you \nC:\tyeah because I'm a good mom \nT:\tand given that experience your tells like your partner maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again \nC:\tyeah yeah no I've told my mom that that's you know that's a last resort and that I'm gonna be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options \nT:\tand that's what you'd like to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police\nC:\tabsolutely \nT:\twhat have you thought about so far? what other ideas do you have about? what you might do in a serious moment where you're scared?\nC:\tmm-hmm for your your well-being and that of your kids I think I'm most afraid you know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control and so I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control and I just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my Minister about it came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before \nT:\tokay yeah so your Minister someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship what are your thoughts what would you what would you say to your Minister what would you like to tell your minister \nC:\tI'm really I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship he doesn't know about he has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me and they starting to kill himself in the children he knows we've had some marital problems some financial problems he knows that Paul's had some drinking problems so there's some of that but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages so I feel like if you know that it's time to tell the minute you know tell him some of that stuff you feel like you've been keeping some significant information from your\nT:\twhat would be some reasons why you would tell him these things what might be some advantages are reasons to do that \nC:\the's been helpful before he's really helped us a lot we've we've had counseling with him over the last five years numerous times and he's been very helpful so it's someone that you trust someone who have a relationship with and he's been helpful in what ways has he been helpful you know I think Paul respects him as a man and I think he cares about Paul so he's not you know my mom and my dad and my friends they they're really bordering on hating Paul and we don't I don't feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him but my pastor has some objective attea and I think he cares about Paul \nT:\tit sounds like your pastor is able to see him as a whole complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like and then there's this other aspect of him that you you really do appreciate and and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well what would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust and that Paul might listen to what would might be another \nC:\twell I don't think that he's going to likely go storming into you know our pastors house Paul oh that Paul won't you know he's gonna heal he comes banging at my mom's door and he kills you know storming over to my girlfriend's house but he's not likely to do that \nT:\tum yeah I don't think you will so so so your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go \nC:\tright should things cool off because things got so out of control and crazy you know and that's not going to happen again \nT:\tso you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was \nC:\tyou know you know my eldest son got involved my arm was was up was harmed things were broken he threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us and I had to call the police and I had to you know have people coming into my house tromping through my house grab and Paul hurting him you know he called me from jail \nT:\tand how can you do this you know what have you done \nC:\tyou know I felt like what have I done how can I do this right \nT:\tso so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children but afterwards it was scary as well because of all the things that all that fallout yeah so so so going to your pastors talking to your pastor possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages are there any disadvantages like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship that Paul will now you know if he finds out that\nC:\tI've talked to our minister about this you know I have no doubt how angry he will be so this could really be a trigger a significant trigger yes if he finds out about it \nT:\tyeah so that's a little bit of a difficult situation \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tas you think about this particular part of a safety plan on the one hand there's potential Lee some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister and at the same time there's this possible significant risk when you think about you know the pros and the cons and in the situation what do you what do you make of that what do you where do you go with that \nC:\tit's it's a risk I'm willing to take you know I have thought about this and it was you know things got so out of control and I feel like it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this differently \nT:\tyou're you're really concerned \nC:\tyeah \nT:\ta part of you is really worried about the next time and you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning and you you also feel like it's a risk that you're you're willing to take given what is at stake and really it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives may be at stake \nC:\tyes you know I think that things can't continue the way that they are I have to figure out something that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul  T \twould it be all right with you if I offered just a suggestion or thought? something to think about in terms of kids and say planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call more run to in the moment when things are if things get really crazy and out of hand I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids \nC:\twell I think my oldest my oldest son that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do he wants to do something he's always jumping in that's how I got her in the first place is he was jumping in so helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe we would be a great idea \nT:\tyeah you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violent situation but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without when he learned done yeah he's becoming a man now too he he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe yeah and as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you you're also really concerned about protecting him and gives him safe and I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do and things that you feel like you actually do have control over I've last time we talked you you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul when he's in his fury in his rage and being violent and what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control you can't control him but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to a possibly a safe person you're your Minister \nC:\tyes\nT:\tand having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in the moment\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand I'm confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any any way that I can and if it's at all helpful i'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more \nC:\tthank you i'd appreciate that \nT:\tthanks for your time\nC:\tthank you  ",
  "﻿T:\thi Liz hi welcome back \nC:\tthank you \nT:\thow are you \nC:\tI'm feeling pretty intense things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time \nT:\twell I'm sorry to hear that \nC:\tyeah I know \nT:\tlast time we talked um you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life so so tell me what has happened what what is what's shifted \nC:\tI think that we've just sort of fallen back you know I was really hopeful that you know what the proposal also came the the promise to you know work on the relationship and work on her anger and work on you know being the couple that we we hope to be and that it's not happening it's not happening we're right back to where we were \nT:\tI'm sorry to hear that I know you were you're excited you were feeling hopeful for change and I don't get that same sense from you right now in fact it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless \nC:\tyeah about situation \nT:\twell how can I may how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now?\nC:\ti just i don't i don't know how to make change i don't know how to I don't know how to end this i don't know how to get out i don't know how to I just I can't do it anymore so you've decided to make a change and in fact it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship I don't know I I mean I want to I don't want to be in it but I don't I don't know how to get to not being in it \nT:\tso you're thinking about it it's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship but correct me if I'm wrong what you're saying is you want to make a change and you don't want this relationship as it is\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tnow what when you think about changing what what ideas i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like \nC:\tI don't know it just feels so overwhelming when I think about it I just I can't seem to find a way out of it and that feels feels ethical feels like it and you know I don't want to hurt her I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore \nT:\twhy don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?\nC:\tit's not healthy it's I'm not happy I can't imagine that she's happy even though she says she is it's you know we're fighting constantly I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her she's overprotective she yeah it just doesn't feel right \nT:\tyou just doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand so um so what would feel right?\nC:\toh that's a huge question hmm I just don't I'm not sure just this isn't right \nT:\tso the way things are is not right it's not working you don't feel supported this isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be \nC:\tyeah I mean when we started it was was lovely she is amazing she was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know we were lots of same interests you know same friends it's you know she was just fantastic and I don't know I don't know where that changed and I feel like we did this on-again off-again stuff and it's just it just seems to like just not right and I know I know I'm don't deserve to be treated this way I know that I'm I'm better than that \nT:\tmm-hmm you really value your self and your well-being and in your spirit and it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though things started out well they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself no but you know but she's lovely \nC:\tand I love her and I can't imagine I can't imagine my life without her in it \nT:\tmm-hmm so you're feeling torn \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou're you're torn between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself and you've got a lot of mixed feelings and you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the a good relationship for you know \nC:\tI think it's good for either one of us \nT:\tmhm for both of you \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twell so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving\nC:\tI mean \nT:\ttell me more about what you've thought about and when you think about making a change in terms of leaving what what might that look like for you \nC:\ti I don't know i mean it feels I just can't imagine my life without her in it so the idea of not having her there feels really scary and the idea of staying the way it is and things not changing feels even scarier so I don't I don't know how to and I don't even know how I would do that our lives are so intertwined I mean my business our friends are the queer community is so small you know that's my fam those are as much as my friends and my family as well and so just you know\nT:\thow do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way \nC:\tyou know for me like in a way that I feel I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself \nT:\twhat what thoughts do you have about how you do that how do extract yourself how might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said \nC:\ti don't i don't even know I mean talk to my friend Jay about it and I don't know he suggested like a break but I don't know I just don't want to get caught in that on again off again before like you know like we've done before and but the idea of a break feels a little less I don't know maybe more gentle \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tI don't I don't know same or a little more gentle I don't know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don't know maybe maybe she'll change maybe maybe if I'm you know if this is it if this is it like if this break is it maybe maybe she'll be able to change\nT:\tmm-hmm I heard you say that live you know moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary in fact it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier and I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that \nC:\tit's just I feel exhausted i feel like i'm not i'm not who I was when I came into this relationship I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy and that just doesn't work there's nothing I can do and I feel like I've lost my joy \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tand I don't know I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tmy peace \nT:\tyeah so you're concerned about your own well-being in your own joy and your your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change and that's the part that's really scary for you \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break and you said that that was a scary thought for you and I guess I'd like to hear more our additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you\nC:\twell I'd it seems like I mean if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what I want and what I need and and you know I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore and and so like if I had that space just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while I don't know it seems like that would be helpful \nT:\tit sounds like you're feeling like you're so in in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it and an advantage a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing \nC:\tyeah\nT:\twell if you don't mind I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here I just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on a scale of  to   being not motivated at all and  being extremely motivated how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now \nC:\tOh like  somewhat motivated yeah \nT:\twhy is six and not a one \nC:\tcuz I know it needs I need it I feel like I'm losing myself so I feel like it's as important \nT:\tyeah well so so why I six and not a nine or ten \nC:\tcuz I'm not sure how to make it happen \nT:\thmm yeah\nC:\tI don't I don't know \nT:\tso it's important to you and you're not maybe fully confident or sure about how the how part yeah make it home exactly well kind of following up on that on a scale of  to   not confident at all ten being extremely confident how confident are you that if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly you would be successful at making that happen \nC:\toh I don't know maybe like a three or four\nT:\tokay so so less confident you're a little less confident than you are motivated why a three and not a zero\nC:\tbecause I I'm on it I mean I do it's something I want \nT:\tmm-hmm and so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen why a three and not an eight or a nine \nC:\tI I can't control her I don't know how she would react and I just don't want any more arguments and anger and yeah and I don't hurt her \nT:\tso when you think about taking this break you're also thinking about how shy she might respond and what she might do and that creates a whole other kind of set of worries and it undermines your sense of confidence on some level \nC:\tit creates a lot of anxiety for me\nT:\tyeah what do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break \nC:\tI think I like maybe a plan like just knowing knowing what the rules are sort of like where where where I want to go with it and and what I'm hope I don't know what I want to accomplish \nT:\tso thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what the boundaries are might might help you \nC:\tyeah regard \nT:\tokay and then one final question on a scale of  to   being not ready at all and  being extremely ready how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break and that let's say the next couple of weeks\nC:\they Nate Nate yeah \nT:\tso so pretty ready\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand and you've spoken to this already a little bit i believe but I'll ask you again why and eight and not on a one or two \nC:\tbecause I know if I just let it drag out that I'm gonna be miserable\nT:\tso your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself and if you don't things are not going to get any better and that that makes you both motivated and even more ready well why why an eight and not a  \nC:\tlets you know scary change is hard and thinking about not being with the woman I thought I was gonna marry bits that makes me sad \nT:\tso your emotions your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way sort of giving up on a dream \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand so another aspect of enter your whole experience is that you're you're grieving mm-hmm the really should should be isn't even over yet but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had and that's a that's a heaviness and certainly a factor in and what you do next \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twell if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me and I I know this is really difficult to talk about so I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you you've been feeling stuck and things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations in your dreams in a lot of different regards you know that you need to make a change you want to make a change and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change you know it's what you want to do it's the right thing for you and you still really care and love Kelly and you're also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup in order to make this more manageable you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change like taking a small break as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready you're somewhat you know you're motivated and it may be a little less confident but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that's all right with you I'd be happy to hear your ideas maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan that big daddy \nC:\tall right yeah yeah thank you \nT:\tthank you very much for your time live \nC:\tI really appreciate  ",
  "﻿T:\toh hello how are you doing today \nC:\ti member you good \nT:\tso i received the email referral from your school on your university housing office contacted me but incident you had providing alcohol I'm really glad to see you here a lot of regular referrals from what doctors offices counselors and schools of this and a lot of people are a little hesitant at first step it's a little scary so I wanna commend you for coming in here taking that first step it's awesome so what brings you today \nC:\twell I've had alcohol in my room a few times and my roommate miss whole University I think on me so I've had a couple meetings with them and I guess they got since it was so many times and it's still occurring that maybe I had a problem and needs chopped someone about it \nT:\tokay how many times have you seen your housing staff \nC:\twith all the zone probably about three times stop their job yeah cuz every time they moan referred to by your living yes it has um maybe my roommate used to be pretty close and then I lost my brother recently and I'm kind of abusing alcohol to do with that and I don't feel like she understands that like she's tried she tried to be there for me in the beginning like you know friends are but I kind of push her away because she doesn't understand that they are all bringing ski of pain that feel however that I was pretty close\nT:\tI'm very sorry to hear about your loss um I know it's hard to lose someone you love and so you might be using alcohol is  means to go with that how the right time processing your feelings \nC:\tI am and because of that I kind of stopped going to class so I think that's another reason that line / my mom really loves before we were this is my second year at school and we became friends last ready to ring together this year and things are going great in the beginning we had this core group of friends and that we would go out on the weekend and we wouldn't let it affect anything and then after all my brother I have just went downhill from there and alcohol just became like I said it hope you mechanism to help me deal with it the pain of that loss and I think that is surely \nT:\tokay so human using alcohols it means to go with your brother and I hear that you have been missing class how often will probably come to me to say to use this class and I Prime Minister's very kind to me so I'm sure that's a little bit of stress for you \nC:\toh yeah I pay for college of my own um and without going to class my grades if I'd fallen and I do get a scholarship that helped me a little bit and if my great fall below a certain GPA and I lose that scholarship and redundant we're getting close so that definitely add some stress\nT:\tokay well first good job for you for paying for school on your own that's really tough I know it's really expensive so that's great and it's good thing that you're working towards education here here you trying you know it's hard to do loss so maybe you could just think of some other ways that you can like cook what the lungs how would you say the typical an eye out with your practicing \nC:\tum well i usually get up around noon and then i'll go to lunch with some of my friends and then i'll come back and take a nap because I thing out really late that I'm four and then I'll get up and shower and get ready there's an eye out although out about nine o'clock sometimes they even go along because my friends don't want to go with me so weak they also three or four blocks and then I six through my alarm in the morning and don't make it class so I don't miss coughing purpose it's just as I through my alarm and then don't get up until around noon if I then x-men suppose my closet so there's no point really going to the other one so so then I knew it all over him right which I mean I understand your chums loves and scene and you have a lot one on \nT:\tit sounds like with lots of your brother and have fingers on your own and trying to maintain a good GPA with class through other ways have you seen alcohol negatively affect early \nC:\twell I've lost a few other friends besides just my roommate I have kind of a new corporate group that some of the ones that I went out with my remaining a curly around anymore away as well because they don't under they also don't understand the drinking so a lot of lost friendships obviously my braids in my GPA and also with paying for school I just have a job on campus and I don't make much money um and right now all that money is going towards to alcohol that apply so financial stress is definitely a big one\nT:\tso you can have a gift straight to your using alcohol to see if the stress so you can think of watching your own but not all can be pretty expensive \nC:\tyeah it's a definitely is expensive for ages\nT:\tum ok so maybe we can think of some ways that you can be stressed without alcohol um can you think of any ways that you could do that?\nC:\tum well I really like working out so I think going to the gym could help a little bit and reading I kind of like it often books and I haven't really used that as a way to cope with this because being with a thing that me and my brother kind of just gathered but I'm going to a point where I think that maybe i can start reading me Danny get less than that is going out I do enjoy i do think i might so go out with my friends on weekends and that's something that i can start doing with my roommate again I just don't want it to that or to become a problem like it had with my forwardness\nT:\tright maybe so maybe when you go out and friends you can find a way to control your is those pom-poms images \nC:\tyes and I can also talk to them about what okay\nT:\twell I really think your idea of working out it's a great one I know that a lot of my other clients have tried it it seems great results not only will it help me destress and but it will all be like you happy release some endorphins Fauria and i'll keep you fit so that will probably want me to shreds  C;\tyeah I hope \nT:\tso great so you refer to me by your university housing office right off of all infraction\tum you've been dealing with the loss of your brother and financial stress of school and worry about your friends so would you like ot take a few steps to take control of your key? \nC:\tI definitely think that I need to take some such source control me \nT:\tgreat so in what ways would you like to do that \nC:\tum well I think definitely the two other things that I've talked about helping me to deal with stress and then I think just coming out things especially like if I slip up and go out and in this class I think besides I want to talk to you about that i think would help and then sing maybe you every two weeks or something great talk about \nT:\tI think that's a great plan so would you like to maybe schedule an appointment for the twisting company and there's great selfie right I will see you then Kelly\nC:\tthank you so much i have a great day  ",
  "﻿T:\thow are you today \nC:\tum I'm okay I just want to like let you know that I know that I have to be here every day this week and I know that this is important but i think i'm going to get here because my car towed and my has a marshal time so i don't know how in the world i'm going to get here so i just want to let you know that up front \nT:\tokay thank you thank you for that and first of all welcome to the Hope Center it kind of sounds like looking at your file that this isn't going to be a place where you can get the help that you need should you choose to come weekly so I understand getting your car impounded is a difficult situation thank you for letting me know that and would you like to tell me a little bit about how that occurred in fact why you're here \nC:\tum well basically I was leaving a friend's house and I are pulled over for speeding and the officers no leave my car and so he calls come out and searched and I had a little weight my car so it got impounded I got arrested and i got charged with missing error from the session and place them a lot of  on probation so part of my probation and the others on here my husband is that i have to complete this program so that's why I'm here\nT:\tit's very difficult i'm sure for you be here first of all and second of all it sounds like a la has occurred so you were arrested after being stopped that can be difficult as well having a dog search your car that's very tough to deal with so we arrested you went to court it does sound like though the judge was kind of lenient that works out for you in fact i'm assuming that if you complete treatment that won't go on your criminal record so that's probably good at it also sounds like you're a little concerned about them now your husband might feel about this situation \nC:\tyeah I mean he's trying to say now that this unfit parent because I got arrested and I mean I've never had my kids have never wanted for anything I've always I go to work every single day I paying the bills I'm there I cook dinner every night in my opinion I don't really feel like marijuana has ever stopped me from doing anything in our life yes I know it's illegal but I don't feel like it's a problem I don't feel like I'm this addict that he's trying to pin me fee you know I just make this all kind of crap honestly I don't have any other problems and I don't know if like me to be here\nT:\tI totally understand that and it sounds like now your husband just is watching you you have a judge watching you and you're on probation but it also sounds like you care about your family and sounds like in your mind and perhaps your vestments you're a great mother you provide for your children they're well fed their well cared for and this is the only probably been it before so I can see where you might not think that this is this is a problem for you\nC:\tI mean I don't think you know this is something that has never affected my life so I don't feel like you know I should have to go through a treatment facility what I don't believe to like have a problem understand \nT:\twell let me ask you this would you mind telling me about maybe how much you smoke every day and what typical day with or without pot just left for you \nC:\twell i mean i usually wake up in the morning and i get my kid tiger school and I send them off to school and then I smoke a bowl and I get ready for work and so I mean I'm not like super high when i get to work I just like knock the edge off in the morning it gets me motivated you know I go to work and I have a really high stress job you have an accountant I an S I have to sit by Manu Peter all day long like crunching numbers and if I don't do something when I would die if I have to sit in this cubicle all day so you know after work you know I come home and I take care of the kids I make sure that you know they're fed they're bathe you know we do story time they go to bed and then I spoke about quite a bit help me sleep but you know other than that I mean I'm a smoke with my friends on the weekends because that's what we do you know we don't drink alcohol I mean that's stupid we don't drink and drive from we just you know me and you know so cold and hang out and you know with each other and I mean that's just what we've done for years in the oven so that'sthat's  years old you know  now \nT:\tso it sounds like wait is this in fact quite a large part of your life your social circles those folks that you hang out with they do that as well as part of your daily routine but it also sounds like you're responsible in that you have a very good job but it's also stressful it is normal for people to look for ways to destress when we come home every day and also to take the edge off as you said morning but it also sounds like you're still making sure you're taking care of your kids that they're fed before they go off to school sounds like there's a lot going on with weed and in your life let me ask you this do you remember a time when you before you were  or time as an adult even that you didn't smoke weed and what life was like for you then\nC:\tyeah when I first married my husband he didn't like it and you know I told him that it wasn't something that I was addicted to and so I'm stop me from watching and he basically said well why don't you stop now and I was like sure why not i'll stop so the first leg two years we were married I didn't smoke at all and then you know life happens me like almost lost her house he lost his job and I just got really stressed out and I just wanted to smoke and he understood because you know it was a really stressful time for both of us and he like didn't say anything about it and so for years now he hasn't said anything about it until now right \nT:\tso it sounds like you're able to communicate with your husband about your your drug use and nice either understood that or not you decided as a couple that you would stop and and then you started back again so do you see now that may be there there might be an issue with with smoking \nC:\tI mean obviously I mean I don't think so but I mean like I want my husband to you know be proud of me and I don't want to be here you know I think this is embarrassing to have to come treatment for so I mean yeah I understand there are you know consequences but you know I just don't I just don't think it's fair\nT:\tright if I can ask you or just let you know and I'm sure you know now there are certain risks when you when you use drugs see you might get caught and you mentioned it earlier that you don't drink and drive but do you see that do you see difference between being high and driving maybe on your way to work in the morning if you smoked a bowl and then perhaps having a couple drinks and drive it to work \nC:\tI mean I feel like I'd refine when I smoke but I mean there have been times where you know I kind of days out when i was driving or and i didn't really remember where I was at and then I didn't it was by exit I was like oh wow I just like completely forgot  minutes of driving no so I mean yeah I think it I think it could be dangerous but I feel like I have a good tolerance like I feel like I could I feel like I'm\nT:\tokay right so what I've heard it before and what I'm hearing from renounced your where there is a risk and it's kind of impaired you driving at one point at the same time you probably enjoy smoking it allows you to take the edge off in distress and I understand that let me ask you this if you don't mind would you picture your husband here in the room with us and maybe tell me a little bit about what he would say about your smoking \nC:\twe did this had in your life still he would tell me you girl out like you would tell me like you have two kids we have two kids we have this life like why do you have to have this thing in your life and and I mean I don't really have an answer for I mean I think it's just something I've always done and you know I don't really know what to do to really change something I've always done \nT:\tright sounds like a difficult decision and one that perhaps you've made in the past with your husband is a couple because you probably chose that i'm guessing to make sure that you take care of your children it sounds like you're both very loving and responsible parents but there's this one small issue that perhaps as a recurring theme in your life and you enjoy it yet at the same time a thinker sounds like you're aware of the risks that are associated with that though\nC:\tyeah i mean i know their wrists and you know i don't want to lose my kids you know I don't want this ever to be something that you know my kids are involved in or you know I've been very careful to keep it away from them and I don't want something to happen and then to find something or to you know start using at  themselves I mean I don't think there's anything personally wrong with it as an adult now but you know I mean I could have used some guy that sat  telling me not to smoke weed well you know hey I would if I don't think there's anything wrong with in it but it would be nice to have had somebody to tell me like don't do that and I don't want my kids to be  you know smoking lead and they're getting it they're all\nT:\tright again it sounds like you're responsible and adolescence is a difficult time and if your children are coming toward that age if they were to see you smoking they could adopt that behavior as well but let me ask you what motivated you to make that change in the past when you and your husband discussed stopping smoking and tell me what that was like just to stop that have you might have done it \nC:\tum I really had to find ways to like calm down because like I just would get really stressed out i mean i would come home and there's a lot going on um I don't know I think I just you know learn how to deal with my stress better and you know now I feel like you know i don't know if i could but i did before so i'm sure you know i could again \nT:\tright that sounds like that you're you remember the time when you just stopped and what i heard is that you said you have you found ways to destress with it without the use of marijuana so it sounds like maybe you come you might be willing to make a change again at this point in your life \nC:\toh I think I could I mean I just don't want I don't want to be in this position again you know like I want to be with my kids I want to do with my husband I mean I do want to just you know make this go away and start afresh you know \nT:\twhat kind of start like this to be there anymore \nC:\tso I mean I'm going to do like whatever it takes obvious that's why I'm here to be done with this so I mean yeah I think \nT:\tso good it sounds like again what I'm hearing is that you are motivated by your children and by the situation perhaps you would like things to be a little smoother between yourself and your husband so think maybe fake down the road let me ask you this where where do you see yourself in a couple of years \nC:\tyeah we talked about have another kid so we have their child we talked about my thing and you know I see myself what's another baby and moving or to Nashville we talked about there's some good job opportunities out there for him and I so that's kind of where I see ourselves right now \nT:\tsounds like you have some Union husband both have goals for growing your family and tell me tell me what life would love be like as you picture it with two children and a newborn and smoking weed every day \nC:\twell I don't think it'll be good I don't think it's something that you know I don't want to be like  year old something waiting you know I just want to find a way to deal with everything that's going on without having to you know explode good so I mean I don't think it's gonna fit my life anymore\nT:\tright well again it sounds like you kind of recognizing that it might be time for we to leave your life again so to speak that you have goals and then perhaps that could get in the way and then you don't see that as a part of your life you know in the future so what I'm hearing also is that there's some amazing opportunity for change here and that we can work on that in the future with you so that's how good \nC:\tokay I'll try great thanks for coming to the hoax\nT:\tokay\nT:\tOh Scott is semi sassy today welcome to the Hope Center for true my name is Miss Andrews and i'm here today to just kind of titled it our program and to kind of see why you're here today so for discuss warrior or our program so why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit why are your name \nC:\twell first of all i had to get a ride because i can't drive until they give me my license back it's going to be a couple of weeks so it's gonna be hard for me to get here for two weeks and kind of pissed off a little bit about it because i've never been arrested for anything in my life and I got a DUI a few weeks ago and it was my first I never had anything like that happen it's really embarrassing and a kind of pissed at work so but the judge diverted it or there's a diversion whatever however they do that but he said if I come and talk to somebody and get a little outpatient help then we'll go on my record \nT:\tso it really sounds like you've had a very traumatic experience with this whole situation said you got arrested and then you had to go to court and everything was found a version \nC:\tyeah traumatic let me tell you the back that police car smelled like vomit I don't know in there before I was it was nasty I've never been in a place like that before it is really really stuck but yeah so I've got the diversion thing going for me I've never done treatment except probably  years ago but anyway yeah I really don't see why need to be here at all of a problem with drinking or anything I just got unlucky I got caught everybody drives drunk I just got caught\nT:\tum I can definitely understand how you feel like they've been singled out you know in this whole situation they were watching you feel like they are watching yeah yeah important people agreeing with these good jobs that's not good what what job do you do tell me about your job \nC:\twell I was the vice president of an aluminum siding company I know it's really excited but I was the VP so I have this big job right I drove everywhere people watch you and they see the man and said go to the bar after work and then they like wait for him to leave I'm have these small towns are they just look out for you but make really good money the problem is now they're a little embarrassed that this happened you know how about drink with the president of the company sometimes three or four nights a week nothing ever happens to him that happened to me so I don't know what's going on but they're a little embarrassed about this so I don't want to lose my job so that's also kind of why I'm here you know I figured what the heck I'll come talk to you \nT:\twell it sounds like you really you know you really care about your job and you're very important what you do you know the vice president of this really really great company and you know you feel like this is something that other people do none of the people have company do and it just happens that you got caught this time does that kind of\nC:\tyeah that's right and you know I'm just a country boy that made a big so to speak you know I just happened to go to school and got lucky and it's not a great company selling aluminum siding is boring as hell let me just tell you there's three colors it's real simple right but you know my wife care about I care about her quite a bit and this is kind of hurt her a little bit too she's not too happy with me in fact I had to sleep out in the camper the other not that wasn't pretty so I'm just saying I willing to you know come here and do this because I want her to be happy with me and they've having lots of money to sell this graph to people so i won't keep doing \nT:\tit so it sounds like you know you really you really have a reason that you really want to be here you care about your wife can you care about your job and you really like what you do is what I'm hearing right now you're good at it look \nC:\tyeah I do like it as much as I joke about it's a good job of in the paychecks nice and the double was beautiful she loves that so I'm just saying you know I want to take care of her she cooks for me every night she takes care of our six kids um got a big family they're getting up in age now in high school they don't need to see this happening to their father \nT:\tso that sounds like you you know you really care right kids in want them to see you you know in a situation like this in the future \nC:\tyeah that's about right you could say that you know I'm not getting any younger and you know I've got it's sometimes it's hard if I drink a lot of night to wake up in the morning you know I'm usually on time for every day you know my father always said wake up and be on time for work I'm doing that but you know say it gets harder as you get over to wake up after you've been drinking at night you have a really good nice and it sounds like you really you know probably on being a good worker and getting there on time and you know it can be hard \nT:\tfrom what I'm hearing that to be getting up now that maybe you know your drinking has gotten a little bit more as you got older \nC:\twell you know the job it's stressful it's stressful and all the kids and I'm going to pay all this money for all these kids in football uniforms cheerleading outfits and cars all that junk you know but I don't want anybody to tell me quit drinking I shouldn't have to that's not you know it's no I shouldn't have to quit completely at all I can still hold my liquor don't get me wrong i understand i mean \nT:\tit seems like you know you feel like you're good dad and you're trying to provide for your kids and it sounds like you do a great job and you know stressful to have six children and you know to provide for them and be a vice president of a company i mean that's it's a lot to deal with so I mean I can understand that you know you feel like you should be able to do these things and and enjoy them and it sounds like you know you don't really know why you're here and you don't really feel like you need to be here\nC:\twell just the judge said needed to the wife's little angry and you know but the main thing really I don't want to mess my life up I want to keep the job in those kids get my groceries and that's expensive so I got to keep making money and I'm going to be able to get another job like this one again \nT:\tI can definitely understand where they're coming from you want to make sure that you have a job and a livelihood for your family and it sounds like you're your wife and your kids are very important to you and that is that for the reason why you're here \nC:\tyeah that is then you know I guess I don't give me hey younger in the doctor said he said then he told me to cut back a little bit I didn't tell me exactly how much I drank but he tested my livery he said you've got this liver enzyme it's a little elevated and it's probably because of that well I'll cut back a little bit but you know I can't stop completely but yeah basically want to keep my job and I don't want to kick off early you know I'd like to live a little longer enough to march football an escort at lunch on this world \nT:\tso you have you've got you've got some health reports back and the doctor said that you had some elevated liver enzymes and so he's to be making a recommendation it's for you yeah we have quit drinking I said hell no it's not going to happen I want to quit completely he said that but you better cut back he said somebody here in should drink anything more than two glasses of whatever a night so he said cut back a little bit but that won't be a problem what I did hear you say that I thought was really great was that you said that you want to sit around for a while but you're not ready to kick the bucket that you do want to think about your health from that you do want to be here \nC:\tyeah that's true I'd be one of them a little longer there's a lot of things I want to do and take some trips with old lady and you know see the kids graduate from college that's important I think \nT:\tthat's great i think that you know you you have a lot of really great goals what would your wife if I had your wife in your children here what would they say about your drinking\nC:\twell they probably \nT:\twell in life but I'm going to come home a little early to be there on kids come on you know after school and if you go out every night with people from work then you don't get home till eight or nine o'clock at night when you get there well you typically go to bed go sleep early so they want to see me a little bit more and then of course this whole thing about going to jail \nC:\twell that just one pretty she's got a lot of friends and I think of friends or they're not making fun of the situation but they're just you know it's embarrassing for dive have to tell her friends and she plays cards with her those get hurt done and everything that oh so that's a little difficult for it sounds like you know \nT:\tyou don't really want her to have to experience some of this embarrassin no she don't need to go through this ever p.m. \nC:\tthat's you know that's that's important to me I love her to death nobody should have to deal with that kind of embarrassment \nT:\tso do you feel like you are able at this time to maybe think about you know not drinking\nC:\twell as possible rimini on drank on La Feria off and on but nothing to wear was a problem but you know I went for the family I could probably look into that\nT:\tScotty you can really see yourself in the next five years where does alcohol fit in your life at this time \nC:\twell I don't know I think things would be a little bit better if if I did give it up I stayed at home you know my wife and I get along really well she's sweet where I enjoy your company so I would like to spend more time on my third take more trips and things so but if you know I don't have a driver's license or a car or job I can't do any of that so it's probably something I would think about just you know I'll drinking at all \nT:\tyou make some very very good points you know if you don't have a driver's license and you don't have these things than you know it's you're not going to able to do the things that you want to do so it you know it sounds to me like you have some things you know that are very important and some reasons and some people enjoy life who could really benefit from you making a change \nC:\tyeah i'm told that a liver is expensive if I need another one so i probably should be good to the one about god that's probably the chain I'll keep me alive quit drinkin and plus I love southern sweet tea so I can switch to that if I need to but I don't want to too soon yeah I think \nT:\tthat sounds great I mean you know they have some flavor tea center delicious set up their format balls \nC:\tyeah \nT:\twell thank you so much for coming in today and I hope that we can we can help out yeah be back next week \nC:\tall right  ",
  "﻿T:\thi Jerry how are you doing today \nC:\tgood how are you \nT:\tI'm good things just wondering how you've been doing since you at the hospital \nC:\tum yeah that's what I've had are we laughs from my depression but I've been doing go with it for the past few months and I've been on some antidepressants and I've been having some going to group therapy so that's been helping me a lot and then I kind of smoking a lot but some pad a lot Ollie asthma flare ups and shortness of breath\nT:\tso you're making some progress so in a group therapy improving with your depression but you're experiencing some symptoms from your asthma you do a bit more about that \nC:\tyeah that's what I can't really run as far and like this when I'm going for a little walk from anywhere I kind of have short power beyond shortness of breath and I just get fatigued really easily I just kind of noticed that how about longstone function like they used to \nT:\tokay so you're getting some shortness of breath and fatigue really easily would it be okay with you if we talked a little bit about your smoking today \nC:\tum I didn't really come in here for a terminal had that much time so i don't know i was just like to get back on with the appointment\nT:\tokay I mean I totally understand that that's a difficult subject to talk about and it's completely up to you I just would like to talk about it with you because I do think and have some magnificent on your health today I'm worried about how it's affecting you in your day-to-day life would it be okay if we talk about your health issues and we can kind of slowly talk about it get into that will take a while we keep making a squeaker as long as you want this is your time and we're here for you \nC:\tokay i guess i'm going to talk about it for a little bit \nT:\tok so in your everyday life how else has being affected you other than the shortness of breath and the fatigue that you've been experiencing \nC:\tum well I'm around my my knees often and my my brother hasn't really want me to washing her unless I like stopped smoking because she gets all the second hand smoke and my my dad died from lung cancer so they kind of suspected that was from smoking so that kind of scares me \nT:\tokay so that's a negative aspect of smoking for you is that you can't be around your niece and that your father has died from smoking so let's talk about maybe some of the positive things that smoking guys for you \nC:\tum that's what it kind of helps with my depression it kind of relaxes me I feel like if I stop smoking it would probably make me relapse and i would start having the suicidal feelings again and also it's kind of like a social aspect where I kind of hang out with my friends and\nT:\tokay so now let's talk about the opposite side we're going to talk about the pros and cons of stopping smoking so what would be some of the negative things if you stop if you decide to stop smoking \nC:\tum I guess I want to be able to hang out with my niece as much as I would like to I might follow along the same path as my dad and I mean I'm sure my lungs would probably get worse if I keep smelling my asthma probably get worse \nT:\tso your eyes one would get worse you can't be with your niece is often and you would be going along the same path as your dad which is ultimately death so let's talk about the positive things of stopping \nC:\tI know I would say a lot of money I would probably have less symptoms my asthma unless short of breath and how you see my knees were and I prod us have an overall better life as much smoke smell my clothes \nT:\tso after we kind of talked about the pros and cons ultimately you have a lot of pros to that you enjoy about smoking it's a social aspect and you enjoyed in a house with your depression but also there's the opposite side where you can't spend as much time with your niece as you want to expect your health it's expensive there seems to be a lot of negative things that you described um well how do you feel about that but there's kind of this discrepancy between the two \nC:\tum I mean it's a really hard decision but I feel like my house is like the ultimate matter\nT:\tso I think like that comes first but again I would just be really hard to stop them like you know in this habit well I definitely applaud you for considering it because I know it wasn't something that you claim to come here to talk about and this was on your schedule but it's definitely important to your health and I'm just like to ask you on a scale of  to  with  being not ready to change at all intending but you're ready to change right now right this second where would you lie on that spectrum \nC:\twell after listen all those pros and cons i guess i would say around a six or so \nT:\tok so y is  and not a two or three\nC:\tI guess it made me step back and kind of realize that I might be following the same lifestyles my dad I could probably end up dead like him from lung cancer and I mean one of my made things that I enjoy like in life is watching my knee so I feel like it would be best for me to style \nT:\tso why a six and not and eight or nine\nC:\thow do I haven't really thought about that much before so I feel like it will take a little time for me to get there but her dad it's just breaking the habit will probably be the most of calls \nT:\tso six is a great start and I definitely think that that's something that we can work with together on do you know of any thing that will help you quit smoking? \nC:\tum I guess I could hang out with another different group of friends or just maybe kind of stay back if they're smoking and try to find something else to do I could also maybe do something to like exercise to kind of get my mind off smoking or do something they'll be beneficial to my health \nT:\tyeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches \nC:\tum no I haven't really thought about it but now that you mention a hug I'll probably look into it \nT:\tokay so let's get you the number and we can discuss the nicotine patches are an alternative for you that would work we can schedule an appointment or in the next two or three weeks and see the progress that you've made and I really am glad that we had this conversation and it seems like you're readily ready to quit so that's awesome \nC:\tyeah thanks for talking to me\nT:\tyeah of course  ",

how important is it for you to make this change and zero being not not not important at all and  being the most important \nT:\tI would see having nine out of ten \nC:\tokay and why is it nine another two or lower number\nT:\tbecause like I said it is really important for me to manage time to exercise so that my diabetes can be managed and controlled \nT:\tand on the same scale of zero to ten how confident are you in being able to make the change\nC:\tI soon I'm probably at eight at a time\nT:\tokay and so would I be correct in saying that it's very important to you so it's nine out of ten to make time to exercise to stay healthy and mainly to avoid having to take medication to manage your diabetes and your confidence level is at eight out of ten and being able to make this change

gets gets to a point I have to that we use with medication \nT:\tmm-hmm so we should like to discuss some of the things you can do to make time to exercise \nC:\tI could take the stairs inside an elevator and watching the brushy brushy store \nT:\twell those are some great alternatives instead of going to gym you save a lot of time so did you we want to know did you want to know more things or ways to find time to exercise \nC:\tyes I feel like that'd be really helpful \nT:\tokay so since you mentioned that spending time with your family was something that you really value ah you could probably and watching software he said you could you know put a treadmill like a exercise machine near your TV Here I am so you can exercise and watch your movie or software with your family and what you can also probably plan outdoor events or outings with your family something that your kids would enjoy so that they can be off their iPads and technology \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthose are something you

roleplay \nT:\tyeah something a little bit about that do you have a character that you roleplay \nC:\tyep I don't play let's go that night they really gonna and Jesus which would be a cat girl OMG and she has red eyes that aren't stairs a pretty long brown hair a black hoodie shirts and black high top converse and she's a dark angel dark angel princess \nT:\tdo you think Lily the dark angel

similar stories to you Lily the character on my breath yes and you also said you like to YouTube \nC:\tyes and I'm watching other people and they make them for us people to watch and half now and not her videos she saw just pull magical gig cats and puppies mmm can't can I can tell you a thing for kick ass \nT:\twell you say cheerful funny so it's a lot of fun yes \nC:\tmm-hmm and she makes funds yeah what's it with a cat pun like guinea and her shedding is a cat-tastrophe \nT:\tyeah so I'm talking to you gee what I hear is your mother thinks you're on the computer too much yep you don't think that's true you seem to be enjoying yourself that around here yes does your mom know that you're having fun when you're on the computer\nC:\tI don't know I mean I think she wouldn't know he doesn't actually throw ups me I get upset and very annoyed because I have to post my video \nT:\tmm-hmm so your mom interrupts what are the race some of the reasons that she interrupts you probably from you throw something away go to track and one where she was nows on the opposite side of the house and let's I think that's the main one so your mom asks you to throw away things unnecessarily do something that\nC:\tshe I know she can do because my foyer oh brother can do it and she's  she couldn't do this \nT:\tmm-hmm so she doesn't need me mmm just like a little much hmm he has more energy so do you usually spend time on the computer alone in your room or where's the computer in your house \nC:\tI usually keep it in my room mm-hmm my bed with a cat hmm \nT:\tso when your mama drugs you you said you have to pause the game when you get frustrated\nC:\tcuz I'm coming like  times in one out she knows she's seen \nT:\tit all if you can imagine why your mom's doing that what do you think would be her reason for interrupting you so that hard way see but doesn't have to get up mmm because you have to tell me hmm I understand watching well it's frustrating yes well it sound like you care what your mom thinks \nC:\twhen she says my hair is next that hurts my feelings \nT:\tmmm \nC:\tbecause she's supposed to be MERIS follow us dogs news I am I have to say I need you here it's pretty fabulous too \nT:\tyeah so your mom interrupts you when you're on the computer um and she ever taken your computer with you or tried to stop you from playing with appear \nC:\tyes she has one time like I didn't need you I shouldn't screw you cuz she ain't on my gummy bears mmm that's a reason j omega versa which is something all of your moment no you get mad mmm my brain turned up you I wasn't in control mmm oh gosh possess me think that's it that's what happened and that happened and then I can use my computer my phone my kindle mmm nothing come in watch TV for three days no electrons for three days yeah night watching TV can you wash them as I didn't want to read all the books at around ten times how many new books so I literally had nothing to dip closer lost all my pencils like a drop \nT:\tso how did it feel when you couldn't play with your xbox you couldn't play with your computer you couldn't look under candle you couldn't play with your phone you can watch TV it sounds like you were left without most of the things you enjoy the most yeah how does it feel \nC:\tit felt like as much to explode or die at any moment and I asked if I have my electrons back mmm I've been a second day \nT:\tmmm couldn't wait ain't no because when you have notebooks like all the books you have our books are very red don't want to read anymore because like you just think of the whole story three head all right just don't let the book in general you look like fences for drawing hi there's nothing to do you will explode mm-hmm do you have any ideas of things you could do or alternative ways to spend your time how did you handle that those three days without your computer \nC:\tI did not handle the I have a pencil just as wasted my time I think she could draw since I have the hunger games series now but an earlier in the year I can read I can't read though stop going to bring back\nT:\tso you have three days without your electronics how are you able to do your homework \nC:\twell um i think it was around left school hmm i don't think i have homework i think is on friday and then well it's difficult to find things to do\nT:\twell I've met quite a few children who have trouble finding alternative ways to spend their time besides electronics most of us are on our phones or on the computer or emailing each other I'm sure you have texting I'm sure you have a lot of homework you have to get done on the computer typing paper and only you can decide what interests you oh it's essential I used to come here mmm so it's necessary right if you want to be a game developer you feel like this is a learning experience for you to get used to play on computer so that you can actually bring it into your professional life later hmm there's your mom realizes\nC:\tI've said a billion zillion convoy like in front of everyone doesn't be getting it up and I go up I don't nothing baby younger i dead \nT:\tmmm so you told her many many times yes attention was missing well she didn't work mmm sipping yeah so it sounds like you you feel like she's not listening to you she's always on her fault she could have no face bone why should people calling people up up mhm she have to go to schoo\nC:\tl said I was a dead bad days away\nT:\toh thanks Emma told Anthony so when you get home from seven hours of school five days a week plus you like to chill with your computer that's your way relaxing it sounds like yes and also I heard you say that you see your mom on her phone all the time so eats the fact that she's playing on facebook and texting while she's telling you not to be on computer seems very hypocritical to you\nC:\tyes it makes me feel function \nT:\tmmm you're angry yes so back to when you you had those three days about electronics you shared that you're reading books or you look back and you wish that you had had certain books during yes let's just say you had a chance to go back those three days and take fun things to do with you bit work relays your phone that weren't related to watching something on TV or netflix urn will get youtube or your kindle let's just imagine that we could go in time and take some fun ideas for things to do this in those three days in fact if you wouldn't mind I could share something with you that I've shared with other kids who have trouble thinking of things to do would you like to show you\nC:\tsure \nT:\tokay so here's a list and every person has their own preference for what they think is interesting your hobbies and that's what's amazing about how different we all are so no no see the dirt just there's something on that list it popped out you something looks fun something that you can't stay I'm doing this is just a general list of things that people do with your time reading and drawing listen to music \nC:\tmm-hmm \nT:\tdo you have another way to listen to music besides your computer hunt down CDs \nC:\tmmm\nT:\twho's your favorite artists do you like listening to rap music pop music\nC:\tI listen to all types of music but I think if I parties cheers one as a favor I would pin 's evanescent around \nT:\tdo you like spending time listening to music what about some of those other activities is anything else interest you that maybe there's something you've never tried before \nC:\tme okay I like petting cats \nT:\twell it sounds like your mom is concerned and getting on your case about being on the computer all the time not spending time with your really is this sound about \nC:\tright and I know the good thing she doesn't want me on computer that's

  "﻿T:\twelcome Jane I'm Stacey how are you today \nC:\tfine thank you \nT:\tthat's good to hear is okay if we just go over a couple of your details\nC:\tyes that's okay \nT:\tokay so from the forms that you've filled in earlier today we found out that you're a  year old female you have bad knees and have been recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis you have recently sustained a tear to your right shoulder culturally you're from a Fijian Indian background you work part-time and have lived in Australia for  years you mentioned earlier that you also assault Carol for you to disable children is that correct \nC:\tyes that's correct \nT:\tI appreciate how difficult it must be for you to look after your children by yourself now tell me what brings you here today \nC:\tmy doctor recently suggested I should lose weight and exercise more in order to take pressure off my knees and joints I know I need to lose more weight and my diet can be unhealthy at times and I don't exercise as much as I should I also find that my knees ache from cooking in the kitchen all day for my family and cleaning the house every other day you say your doctor suggested you to come here today but did you want to come here as well I think with my doctor making a point of me coming it bought it to my attention more I know I'm more a little overweight and maybe I should improve on my on my health for me and for my children say the doctor mentioned that excess weight was not helping the pain either \nT:\tyou said that your doctor mentioned that you should come here today that perhaps maybe I can help you some of these issues if you were to change or improve any area of your life where would it be \nC:\tI guess to try and lose more weight and take the pressure off monies I'm starting to feel uncomfortable in my clothing and finding that I get tired when i walk small distances and big need to feel frumpy and heavy on my feet and I'd like to be not so puffed out when I walk small distances being on my feet so long makes my joints ache as\nT:\twell it must be difficult feeling that way and uncomfortable hopefully I can help you with this how important is it for you to change your life right now on a scale of  to  \nC:\tI would like to say about  I think I'm ready to make a change in my life I'm always doing things for other people um I've been listening to my friends and they say I should start looking after myself more\nT:\tthat's good to hear that your friends are looking after you how confident are you being able to make a change in your life honestly \nC:\tI'm not sure I've tried to lose weight before I lose a little and then put it back on usually when I'm busy \nT:\tyour stress \nC:\tI'm not set on the fact that exercise can be effective for me when I exercise my knees hurt and I don't want to lift every ways I understand how difficult it must be for you to lose weight and put it back on again\nT:\tbut you did say that you could lose weight how did it make you feel at the time \nC:\tI felt Gordon was proud of myself and I went out and even bought a new top \nT:\tso it sounds like that when you lost weight you felt better that's great and why do you think exercise may not have worked or being so effective for you \nC:\tI'm not quite sure maybe because I wasn't doing the right things or getting the right advice you could be right can you see that maybe at the time this is why am i noticing improvements I know it should have probably seeked out more advice from a professional again it was just the timing of it and I thought I could do it myself \nT:\tI'm sure you could do it by yourself but a little assistance and some knowledge never hurts what do you think changed that made you potentially put the weight back on\nC:\tI think because I stopped walking on the treadmill I wasn't really caring about the amount of carbs i ate at mealtimes and in my culture we eat a lot of rotor which is our form of bread we ate this with most meals I don't really do anything else but take occasional medication for the pain \nT:\tokay it's important for you to recognize that amount of bread that you're eating probably wouldn't have helped and also the fact that you stop walking on the treadmill would lower your capacity to burn that food which an along one would affect your rheumatoid arthritis now that you say it \nC:\tI probably knew that it's just Bernard recently to find the time and to get back on the treadmill I work part-time and my children take a lot of my time up so it's really difficult and I hardly get a minute to myself that's completely understandable\nT:\tfrom what I can gather your main issues preventing you from exercise include time and family obligations basically\nC:\tyes it's stress for loving to be the sole carer for my family I love my children but they can be hard work it must be but \nT:\tyou can see in order to lose weight and improve on your symptoms diet modifications and some sort of exercise need to be implemented into your daily routine yes that make sense\nC:\tbut do you really think that this would help me \nT:\tof course it would but you'll need to be committed to your own personal improvements look at how committed you are although it is hard work looking after your family that's true I see your point what do you think it would take to change your mind about participating in physical activity \nC:\tmaybe being able to do exercises that don't take too much time up things I could do at home or it would be great if I could in of my children sometimes \nT:\tokay so if you were given a program that was realistic with time and easy completed at home do you think you could do this\nC:\tI think I could give it to go I want to improve my overall fitness I would also like to feel comfortable in myself and reduce the aches and pains in my body great \nT:\tso it seems as though you have put a lot of thought into your overall goals what if i say to you come back and see me in two weeks do you think in that time you would at least attempt to start the program provided \nC:\tyes i think i could give it a real girl and try to make it a priority for the next two weeks \nT:\ton a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be successful\nC:\ti'm going to say nine out of  because nothing certain that's an interesting way to look at it \nT:\thopefully we can get you to  by the end of it hopefully so I can see you're willing to make an effort let's say we meet here in two weeks then hopefully it's hopefully you have some competing exercise of sessions and progress to show me I try my hardest that's all I ask for i'm looking forward to helping you through this journey Jane it was nice to meet you \nC:\tyou too  ",

I counseling center so have you thought any more about those options \nC:\tit could be a good possibility I could try that out it can always be for the better \nT:\tokay and so I ask you to think about the pros and cons so what are some of those that you came up with \nC:\twell some of the cons to it it's going to be you know part of my time my name is a factor mm-hmm like with a doctor since I do not have insurance\nT:\tokay so taking out time out of your day and the money are obviously some big concerns that maybe we can look into you and we're gone but what would be some positives of doing that \nC:\toh it would be the outcome with it for the positive part would be tremendous like I would be able to with \nT:\tthe Counseling Center they provide a service or you're able to\nC:\tsince I do lose focus a lot I'm allowed to take my test in a controlled environment with only by myself and I get extra time you name it enables me to have better focus all around \nT:\tokay so um now while those are obviously some things that would help you what are some things may be stopping you from doing those already because clearly you know that those are things that are available to you but what stopped you up until now\nC:\twell with the Counseling Center was taught me was having to have a written agreement and approval from a outside doctor okay but also some other positive aspects of like you know trying to take care of the th ed problems and my time management skills some positive outcomes of those would be being able to function throughout my day besides just you know my test and the Counseling Center \nT:\tokay so they would help improve really socially socially and a work as well because we didn't talk about some more issues that came up throat okay um now what are some positive attributes that maybe you think you already have that can help you make these changes now what are some things about you that make you think you can definitely do this \nC:\toh um I'm a go-getter if I know something and I'm strive enough to do it I'll do it\nT:\tokay \nC:\tgive me a few more let's see here um I make sure when I start something I make sure I finish it \nT:\tokay well I don't ever try to leave any things left undone ok so maybe thinking about those maybe we can apply those to you no more ways to motivate you to make those changes and get towards your solutions \nC:\tokay great  ",
  "﻿T:\tHarriet I'm happy to be here \nT:\toh it's so good have any way so you know hi study  weeks what do you want is the end it's a really big baby this big you're looking so good from your desire it's wonderful \nC:\tyeah thank you \nT:\tyeah I know you mentioned last time about the drinking of the alcohol and certain things about that we did cover certain things that can happen when you're drinking now can I ask you a very broad or open-ended question apart from alcohol fetal alcohol syndrome what are some of the other things that you that might happen to you or your baby if we keep drinking during pregnancy \nC:\tI know there are some problems but I'm not quite sure all of them \nT:\tI would like you to go with that with me again if it's possible \nC:\toh yes\nT:\tit's good to we just keep reiterating on what's important well apart from fetal alcohol syndrome there are some pretty serious conditions that can also come in because if you're still drinking for a start you can get malnutrition it can interrupt your whole metabolism you actually lose your appetite a bit and some of those really important minerals and vitamins that should grab the bag of you and your baby you're going to miss out on so that's going to be one of your big problems and it can also upset your fertility for next time around and not many people realize that so your whole cycle can be pulled out and you might try have trouble falling pregnant again so there's some pretty serious side effects apart from the fetal alcohol syndrome that you might find affect you in your baby also too they found in some recent studies that the baby can be bored very restless and unsettled so even if it doesn't get fetal alcohol syndrome a lot of clinicians say they can see a baby that's been born to a mother who has been drinking during pregnancy there they actually unsettled hard hard to rest though they that they don't follow the normal patent of a newborn \nC:\tyeah that's sounds pretty awful \nT:\tyeah \nC:\tit's not something that I want to my baby to live\nT:\tso we really need to work on some strategies down that way so and then probably my next target with you is to talk about how brave you are an affirmation of how brave you are to come in and tell us all about just how this drinking is affecting you and the fact that you want to stop yeah thank you\nC:\tit's it's hard it's hard um I drink to relax and i think it's it's a habit that emits for a long time and once i get my first doors it's hard to stop so yeah and i've heard some from some people saying and some friends told me that it wouldn't be good for the baby but i don't know it's just hard and \nT:\tit's so proud of you two coming because a lot of people won't even admit to it let alone come until the Midwife what they're doing when they go home so it's just so very brave of you to come in and tell us all about hey drinking and what we can do together to try and help you stop that \nC:\tyeah I don't know I was thinking about maybe if I put some signs for myself around the house especially in the frito whatever just to remind myself that drinking is not good for sure and I don't know the other thing maybe just don't have the first dogs \nT:\tyeah absolutely if you don't have that first if you can stop yourself having that first drink you're more inclined not to keep drinking of course\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tit's wonderful you can't have the strategies you so far\nC:\tthat's wonderful yeah I think I might try \nT:\tthat just many want wanting to quit smoking you don't just remind yourself all the time and don't have the first don't have the first and don't start don't start \nC:\tso yeah this is my strategy for the moment I don't know I would just have to try and see how it goes and I'm glad that I can talk to you what so the next time I can tell you what had been doing this period in if I was succeed or not \nT:\tI said if it sounds wonderful it's really important to that I reflect on your feelings that's all all part of this and from what you're telling me there's a great sense of guilt and frustration with what you're doing is through its draw \nC:\tI don't want to do that but it's sometimes it's stronger than me \nT:\toh yeah but you're coming up with these wonderful concrete and practical strategies on how you can attack it \nC:\tyeah now that I know that it's affecting my baby I think that's one of the things that I think it's going to be my you know pop I will get them some strength from that from that knowing that it's gonna harm my baby and so and I put some signs for myself \nT:\tum it's gonna harm your baby \nC:\tit's gonna hold a waiver morning also yeah just fantastic \nT:\tI just want to summarize now because it's so important because this is such a profound topic for you to talk about and it's really important that I've taken on board everything you've said now we've been through I know we've been through apart from alcohol the syndrome that we've talked about in depth we've talked about other things that can happen with you in your baby if you continue drinking we went through all of them one by one and you seem to get a good handle on on those things because you're able to repeat them all to me you told me that you felt this great sense of guilt and shame about the whole thing about drinking but you have no problem talking to me about it which is wonderful and then you came up with these wonderful strategies that you can up with yourself how to remind yourself that it's bad fit with the signs not if you don't have the first drink your lesson plan to have the third of the fourth so how to stop yourself having that first drink you think is how you get these changes so so that's wonderful so I've understood where you're coming from do you think by summarizing little \nC:\tyeah yeah yeah \nT:\toh you don't yeah it's totally absolutely dead fantastic I just want us to elicit now some change talk and he did talk about those strategies that you were going to do yourself which is exactly what we want we want them to come from you because they're going to work for you is there anything else that you can draw on to make those things happen to stop your drinking no not at the moment not that I can think of but I'll certainly be more aware keep their end up in my mind so if any other strategies that I can come up with i'm going to write it down and bring it to you when we can have a gentle dead \nC:\tokay\nT:\tfantastical thanks for coming in today  ",

lot about it and I know exercise a major contributor to my diabetic health so I would say it's pretty important maybe a seven\nT:\tokay okay very important and how confident would you say you are about making this change right now \nC:\tmaybe a two\nT:\tokay so from what I hear you saying you've had some success in the past without cheating behaviors related to your diabetes it's just life is

it's very important to me and do want these things for my health I just I don't know how to do it \nT:\tso from what I hear you saying um you're having difficulty fitting exercise into your schedule and you know the importance of exercise for diabetics what would it be beneficial to you if I provide you with a little more information would that be okay \nC:\toh yeah definitely sure please I would like to know about them\nT:\tokay well but you exercise can help lower your blood glucose and that's important for diabetics and I can all also help lower your blood pressure regular exercise can also increase your energy improve your sleep strengthen your bones muscles there are a lot of benefits which one of those benefits do you think you would appreciate the most energy I'm really glad to help how can you say that like\nC:\tI would love to have more energy to do the things I do throughout the day and I definitely don't sleep well at night so I didn't even know these were things that came along with exercise and diabetes like having the energy to go through my day and being able to sleep and be awesome actually\nT:\tit sounds like you're getting kind of excited something that connects my life and like it makes sense right so you'd really you'd really benefit from including exercise oh and it sounds like you're really willing to try to change can you think of some ways you might include exercise in your day\nC:\tyeah I would love to try harder to make this change and I guess if you if you talk about including ways in the mornings I go to work around  and then take my kids to school but I Drive them back so maybe okay \nT:\tdo you think you'd be able to how often would you be able to walk them to school this week\nC:\tI assume they go to school every day yeah so I can try for all five days \nT:\tokay that would be great \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso would you you'd be able to walk them to school every day and maybe keep a track of that you've done it for the day and maybe just check it often that way you know you know you've got your exercise in \nC:\tyeah I couldn't try to do that this week \nT:\tokay so now that we've discussed these things a bit how one confident are you

with it \nC:\twell right now fun and it seems like something that I can manage doesn't come involve too much of my time so I think I'll be able to do it \nT:\tdo you think there might be anything that might get in the way in the next week of you doing that\nC:\tno the only concern I would have is work but I don't start wonderful  and the school school kids go to school at  I'll be ok ok \nT:\tok

stitches then I'm going home\nT:\twell it's great that's a good thing that you're going home soon um I have ten minutes that I can maybe sit down and talk with you if you have answers or questions for me is there anything that you'd like to talk to me about \nC:\tum not really but honestly this is really bugging me this priest came in here and gave me this wire for a and I'm kind of offended like why would he give listen to me I don't know so just bothers me so you say that a priest came by and gave you this brochure for alcoholic anonymous \nT:\tyeah yeah and it's just is really upsetting you because you don't think that you need \nC:\tI'm not an alcoholic\nT:\tyou don't believe that you're an alcoholic oh I mean I could understand how upset you can be people think that you're something that you're not great um would you like us to explore a bit more about you know why is what do you think that the priest gave you this did you have any ideas why you would hand you such like a brochure like this\nC:\tOh Bonnie I guess it kind of makes sense because I'm here because I got into a partner right and I got hurt so maybe he just thought you know bar fight she's got to be a drunk maybe that's what he thought\nT:\tokay so would you like to tell me a bit more butch his bar fight that you like\nC:\thonestly I don't remember much because I know I was drinking I was having some fun with my friends but I think I guess this girl just got to me and and sometimes I get a little crazy and I don't know what happened but I know I hurt now so you got into a bar fight\nT:\tright and and you you would jump Harry oh yeah and you didn't know what was really going on but you know you just think that maybe this girl was not saying something good to you and then you get into this fight \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tokay um would you let would you allow me to explore a little bit more about the drinking and alcohol\nC:\tit's really okay \nT:\tso how does alcohol affect you like what what does he do for you is doing it like \nC:\tI like it it's fun I go out with my friends and we go drinking and like after work it's like the best way to just chill you know is to have a beer just relax so for me it's fun and it's my way of just relaxing and hanging out with my friends \nT:\tyeah I understand so you you like having fun your friends drinking is a normal thing for you guys to do and you don't see a problem with what you're doing with your friends like you're just drinking one \nC:\tI'm not driving um you know yeah it's just fun\nT:\tso it seems to me that drinking is not really a problem that you in your life right now um but would you say though that there are some negative effects that that alcohol is doing in your life right now it would you like to tell me if it's affecting you in that way?\nC:\twell I mean I I'm kind of cut up so that's not a good thing related to my drinking I guess Joey he's my boyfriend he really doesn't like it when I'm drinking and we get into a lot of fights and he says I'm just not normal when I drink so I guess that would be the negative stuff \nT:\tso I like it he said your friends drink you drinking is fun something fun but on the flip side and the bad side it's affecting your relationship with your boyfriend he does not like it the way you act are you drinking so it is affecting the relationship negative rate okay um so back in the Alcoholics Anonymous if you of mine I'm so we what do you know about a it's a meeting for people who drink \nC:\tmm-hmm\nT:\ttalk about it okay so you know under your the right track about you know people meeting it's a group of people um that talk about alcohol okay so with your boyfriend it sounds to me that is what you say is how Koren is he in your life marry that guy he's important we're gonna be like together okay so that's great you know at least you're thinking about a feature with Joe and you think that he's really important in your life right now um and then you also said that he does not agree with the drinking I would like to ask you this question now would you be willing to take it a step further and maybe check that \nC:\tI check out one of these programs \nT:\tfor the sake of your relationship is that something that you're willing to look at willing to in the future\nC:\tyeah or never thought of it before but I'm willing\nT:\tum so okay I would like to give you a scale of  to  in a scale one to  how likely would you go and check out one of these programs is \nC:\tsex sex Elton\nT:\tso you would say to safe that's very surprising because it's not a one like it's very good why would you say it's not a one and it's a six that you're likely to go \nC:\tbecause of Joey like he doesn't like me drinking hmm I mean I'm only  it's not affecting my health now but I know when I get older and really affect my health and Joey won't stop babies and he keeps telling me I can't drink and if I want to get pregnant \nT:\tso I mean those are the things that's really I recommend it for that you're thinking about a future Joey you're thinking that maybe you'll have children with him someday and if you do try you think that it will make your relationship better which one factor should be a good way how well he said it's a six right so what do you think would happen would need to happen to make it a nine for you that you really like most likely to just go in and try one of these programs \nC:\twell I guess like if the place was closed then if I like the people there and if I got something out of it then it would make me go \nT:\tokay that sounds good and it sounds reasonable that if it's closer to you it's easier for you to stop by \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tum if you'd like if you're interested I would be able to help you find a place a closer area where the program is hell it's easier for you to to get there it's closer to your house would you be willing to find out a bit more about that \nC:\tsure yeah \nT:\tokay so thank you for talking to me about this whatever village for Joey and how alcohol is maybe affecting your relationship and you know and your may be willing to go and try one of these programs would you like to meet up with me in the next two weeks and see how how this program is to you like if you've tried it if you have any more questions or concerns for me look at where you are at in this situation is that something to do it \nC:\tyeah I did you later \nT:\tokay so Thank You Leanne um this is a big stuff for you I know I'm it's hard to make a step like this but I'm thankful that we have this stuff today and I hope to see you again soon you're too weak \nC:\tthank you  \n",

daytime and i can't wait them and say you take you find yourself more you've been finding yourself taking work how much is that increase over the last last one half \nC:\tas long as shit there Toby vision \nT:\tokay and have you talked to your doctor about possibly increasing the dosage what you doesn't want to do that so I hadn't go to their doctor to get you more \nC:\tok \nT:\tso now you're seeing two doctors to work with the pain medication right for your back \nC:\tyes \nT:\tand that's so that you can get more is that because the first doctor won't give you communi give you enough ok and he gave you as prescribed in the beginning a specific amount and if he go he did he did well he gave you a specific amount and he's not willing to go any further good woman they could okay and so but you felt that you needed to get more difficult Lee okay so you went to a second doctor together to get more okay I'm just trying to clarify to make sure that i understanding correctly has heaven do you know what tolerances loaded with black people no tolerance is and when it comes to medications and drugs and alcohol so when a person would take a certain amount of medication or they might take a certain drug or they might drink a certain amount and they would continue to increase the amount and as time went on their body could only take so what their body kit would want more it's like creating one more and more and over the last month how many times have you increased your medication we could really keep track Tyler to the right foot listen let's narrow it down \nC:\tmaybe over last week or I can't I your only lasts about two hours to latch run into some flashes \nT:\tokay so it it's only lasting two hours and it's posted last hour motion much hold for four hours of time but it's only lasting two hours and then you're taking more increasingly and so your date or how many times have you increase that dosage on your own couple times \nC:\tI suppose\nT:\tokay \nC:\tso how how much should be taking her per day now as opposed to its prescribed every four hours \nT:\tso you should you should take it every four hours and you've taken it took it over to every two hours and how many pills to build two pills so technically you're supposed to take it every four hours so in a -hour period you're taking it about five times or six times maybe and what you were you were prescribed to Kazakhstan \nC:\tright \nT:\tokay and sat down and now you're taking it a total of twelve times ouch \nC:\tokay \nT:\tand that's over a month period \nC:\tokay \nT:\tall right it sounds can I make a suggestion or can I give you a little bit of feedback it sounds to me like it is that you're increasing that you've increased your tolerance because of the amount of pain that you're having you've increased your increasing a tolerance level for the medication handle so much medication and you're building up a tolerance now for it that's the beginning stages of addiction and I wouldn't say that you're in too bad a shape at this point or anything but what concerns me is that you are increasing your amounts of medication regularly you're seeing a second doctor to get more deep do you see a problem or discrepancy with my backers \nC:\tokay\nT:\tso you're a problem \nC:\tokay\nT:\tall right you you have taken medication that you took over the prescription hands against your doctors for or orders on them and then you saw a second doctor to get the second amount medication you're building up a tolerance and a resistance to the medication if you continue to take the medication at this rate where do you think you'll be in the next  days okay right now you're taking medication at a rate of taking you started off with one let's take two pills okay originally at your six times a day every four hours I believe I'm doing my math right \nC:\tokay \nT:\tand you increase you doubled that in at one stunna against the wishes of your first doctor and you spoke to a second doctor is your first doctor note about the second doctor what about the second doctor so they don't know each other they don't know ok so that's a problem in a bits out there that \nC:\tI don't I know\nT:\tit's because you're you're in pain but you can crease your mouth over this last month if you continue on this trajectory continue moving forward doing what you're doing right now I month down the road where do you think medication intake is going to be super trippy you'd probably be double introduced no double what is now you see a problem with that sounds like at this point right now you're you're you're you're lucky because you're very very early in the stage statements\nC:\tokay \nT:\tbut if you continue forward with it it can become an increasingly highly addictive problem and you would you would need a formal treatment inpatient treatment at this point you that's not necessary impatient Rick we what we would need to do is determine boy or like for us both determine what we could do to manage the pain slow down the amount of medication you're taking before \nC:\tokay \nT:\twould you well first of all first thing I would like that is on it at this point right there on the scale  to   being least important  being most highly important where where do you see yourself right now as high as important as this how important is it for you to change your current path help with that quick pretty close for joining a time \nC:\tokay eight or nine \nT:\tokay would you would you be interested in possible pain they're seeing that they're just because I I can refer you to a therapist that helps with pain management it's not medication base it wouldn't take you off your current medications that would help you manage your pain better through several techniques and therapies it's relatively low cost and expensive and the money that you'd be spending to increase your medication you actually be saving by seeing the pain being retired doctor yeah and that way you would have to see two doctors regularly but you can't do some a management as well let me ask you another question on a scale another scale scale of  to  on confidence level how confident do you feel that that you could get some help and change this district\nC:\tthat wouldn't be as high because my back hurt \nT:\tyeah it hurts all the time so that makes you look pretty that would be a more under scale so a little bit lower on the scale okay so because your back you think your your back let's talk about that a little bit just for a moment here when you're hurting and your back is hurting tremendously what's besides trying to relieve the pain let's really what's what's going on through your mind well you can never get relief with these lay down or sit down or stand up it hurts all the time hurts a little less when I'm moving around when I'm still more contrary it bothers more right now just having to sit here that's all I nobody tell you about it so do you would you do you want to we talked about you want to consider  shortly then what we want to do is make it would you like to make a goal and follow up about it about a week or so perhaps make a smart home real like what we could do is one have a specific color plan perhaps maybe see I'll refer you to my my reps is verb for pain management specialist do you think you could what's a good time you could probably make an appointment to see him probably tuesday or thursday tuesday or thursday \nC:\tokay \nT:\twhat's a good time you can come in and see me again  that's weak do you think you can add it in gate you cook \nC:\tokay \nT:\tdo you think maybe tuesday you can see the pain specialist and management specialists and then maybe CD on thursday just follow just to show check in see how you're progressing \nC:\tokay\nT:\tZack seem attainable an attainable goal for you so far ok and then so we kind of boiled that down so it's actually going to be time times of actually the soul what time on thursday time Jepsen afternoon two o'clock in two o'clock\nC:\tokay \nT:\tI think that you I mean it still looks like talking to you you I know that you something kind of summing it up everything you didn't at first you didn't see the direction that your pain medication might be taking you in but now you clearly see that it could take you in this direction that could really be harmful to do good okay and that's the pain management might be a better alternative coming coming together with the medication and in a piglet pain medicine and actually is some sort of treatment therapy kind of work on some ideas to try to help you sunny weather swine okay and hope we'll see it and see basically if that works and we can go from there next week we need to get their gear \nC:\tsure \nT:\tokay Don it's been really good to talking with you today thank you  \nC:\tall right you have a good day I think that was a little bit better  \n",
  "﻿T:\thi Ashley my name is Noel and I am the social worker that is assigned to your case today how are you I'm doing \nC:\tokay \nT:\tum first to start the session off with I just want to touch on our confidentiality policy so that entails you I want you to be able to disclose everything that you can to me but I also AM supposed to inform you that if you disclose anything that could either harm you or is going to harm somebody else that I need to inform the proper authorities \nC:\tokay \nT:\tum and then I also just want to let you know if you see me taking notes or anything don't be worried it'll just um just sort of help me out stuff like that so um why do you think you're here today \nC:\tum well basically I for the past couple years I've been stealing a lot of stuff like I'll go to like Walmart and Target and victoria secret and all these stores and I'll to steal a bunch is like clothing and like headphones and easy stuff to steal not necessarily the clothing because sometimes I have to rip the security tag off but i'll either stick in my bag or I'll like put it under my clothes and I'll walk out or whatever and basically my mom asked me the other day like why I have so much nice clothing and I don't really have a job or anything and basically she kind of figured it out and made me come here\nT:\tokay um so first of all first of all I want to commend you for coming in here today and taking that first step um so I want to start off with asking do you think that this is a problem for you \nC:\tum I do kind of think it's a problem because I started off stealing like really little stuff like gum and candy and like magazines and stuff and now I'm kind of on to like the bigger stuff like the stuff that costs a lot more money so i think it is kind of a problem because it's gotten progressively worse okay so it definitely \nT:\tsounds like you understand that the problem is progressing um well on a one to ten scale  being the most serious how serious have a problem do you think this is and you're like right now \nC:\tI feel like it's like a  because my parents I think the reason I do it is because my parents don't really have a lot of money and they never really had a lot of money and I I still want to be cool and have like the latest fashion and hang out with my friends and and then not judge me for having not cool clothing and stuff and like the cool stuff so like I feel like it is a problem I need to address because it's getting I need to stop doing it since i'm almost out of high school \nT:\tokay so um I can tell that you'd feel like because your parents don't have a lot that you kind of feel the need to steal in order to kind of keep up socially \nC:\tum yeah okay \nT:\tso what would have to happen for you to know that this is a problem or move higher up on the scale of how serious \nC:\ti think the i think i would need to have to like get into serious legal trouble probably like arrested or or like a charge or something or like just something really scaring me because right now I feel like I'm like nothing that's going to happen to me because I do it all the time and I've been doing it for a long time \nT:\tokay well it's it's definitely good that you grasp the possible consequences of jail time and things like that what do you think that the pros and cons of making this change our \nC:\tum I think the pros are that I would probably stay out of trouble and the other pros would be like my family like my mom would be off my back my dad wouldn't be like embarrass I do it and the cons would probably mean that like my friends might not think on my school because I don't work will close and I think it might be kind of hard for me to stop because I've been doing it for so long \nT:\tokay um so would it be safe to say that friends and family are definitely something that you value\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tI lee in your life they're pretty hot \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tum so I think I'm seeing a little bit of a discrepancy between your behaviors and then I guess your relationship with like your family and friends do you feel like these behaviors affect your relationship with \nC:\tdefinitely because my mom and dad have been like really on me about it and then like my friends don't know about it but i just feel like if i do like end up getting in trouble when i go to jail that like it's going to be even worse for me like socially because they weren't like wow she didn't steal and she went to jail for a long time for stealing when I could have just told him that I has happen money issues \nT:\tyeah um well what do you think that you could do to overcome these barriers and make it easier for you to change these behaviors\nC:\tum I think that I could tell all my friends that like I am having him on each other when I've always had money trouble and if they don't understand if they don't understand and they're not my friends and I could if I ever felt like I needed to steal I could talk to like my mom or my dad or my sister my brother before I feel the urge to steal and then I guess lastly I could try to find a job\nT:\tyeah definitely those are a lot of good ideas um do you believe that changing these behaviors will be in your best interests \nC:\tuh definitely because I really need to stop doing it because I'm I'm getting too old for it and I don't want to have to go to jail \nT:\tum okay well it looks like we're almost out of time here so um just in between like now in our next session if you feel like you have any compulsions to to steal or anything like that um I want you to kind of focus on these goals and things that we thought about that you could do or like talk to your family members or even talk to your friends about Hannah being a support system and helping you to maybe avoid these feelings that you need to steal and then in our next session we'll talk more about smaller steps to get you going on your way but I think we made a lot of progress like this session and so yeah well that's a good place to stop and we'll pick up where we left off \nC:\tall right thank you  ",
  "﻿\nT:\tso where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other\nC:\tyeah my as was just been out of control lately and my doctor says it might be connected to Oscar\nT:\thmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse\nC:\tI've got allergy testing it's just the dust makes it bad I thought the smoking was the main thing that's cut down and then they said the drinking might contribute to it too so I got a lot of different things I'm working on so that's what I know the drinking the smoking and the dust that I got the scratch test for right and and that's what I know and that I take the medicine for it\nT:\tokay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern \nC:\tno I've had it for  years and now it's a concern I don't understand \nT:\thmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free \nC:\tdoes that work what the boy said \nT:\tyeah okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards \nC:\tthat mm-hmm I'm a little I'm a couple down I used to drink for a night now I'm down to three at least\nT:\tokay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next\nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tokay so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms \nC:\twell we keep him clean like he's clean so all the dander doesn't really make sense but I have been noticing sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside I wheeze a little bit but I think it has to do with um the hair the in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking so I don't know if it's that that's where I'm confused I don't know how this could be happening \nT:\thmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution\nC:\tbut the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit I guess\nT:\tI also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long \nC:\tmm-hmm mmm I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I want to feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life in it honestly feels like my my nose is just above the water \nT:\tmmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice \nC:\thmm ya know that feels good that I you know ELISA it is my choice I just feel like just about I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up and I'm kind of sad about things and I don't know I don't know what to do \nT:\tthere's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby \nC:\tyou know I want I want Giancarlo to grow up with Oscar so he has his friend when he's young too and I just it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you got to think about and I'm not feeling good about it \nT:\tmm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not\nC:\tyeah how would I know I don't know I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine if she gave me the strongest medicine and I wasn't working \nT:\tmm-hmm\nC:\tthat would be the way right now cuz I can't see I don't know how I'm gonna give this dog up \nT:\tyeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry \nC:\tno no it's something I got to just sit there and kind of put the pros and the cons on the table about but something's going on  \n",
  "﻿T:\thi Chris I thanks for coming in today and filling out our survey I wondered if it's okay if I go over a couple of things that that you answered in the survey \nC:\tyeah it's fine \nT:\tokay one of the things that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tokay and I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas and and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms\nC:\twell I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to do much for me and just kind of hassle to go out and get them so okay I don't really use them for that reason\nT:\tyou've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage okay so Chris it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage \nC:\tyeah that's okay \nT:\twhat some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia along with HIV they're really effective in preventing these things and there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free and local pharmacies drug stores have condoms and there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free and there's some some ways too that people have found carrying them around pretty convenient you know in their car or in their pocket because they're pretty small what does it sound like as I'm talking what are some thoughts that are going going through your mind \nC:\tdefinitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me and if they do protect against all that stuff that you said I mean that sounds a lot better than what I have heard I definitely want to avoid all those consequences \nT:\tokay we're not interested in and coming a father right now I'm guessing \nC:\tnot yeah \nT:\tokay great well can I ask you so after this conversation today on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance in using condoms with you now.\nC:\tafter everything that you've told me it sounds pretty important to me we're like an eight or nine \nT:\tokay okay well that's great it sounds like you really have you know a plan in mind what do you think you'll do next like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception and condoms\nC:\t probably go out and look for some condoms \nT:\tokay we have an open mind to them okay well we've got some here at the clinic would you like me to give you some on your way out and you can just take them with you\nC:\tYeah\nT:\tGreat well thank you so much for talking to me it was nice to meet you\n",

  "﻿T:\tyou leap in so far I'm still a little bit anxious \nT:\tyes last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety and according to my notes you were going to look into some yoga classes you were going to attempt to drink less coffee you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature so I'm wondering how all that went \nC:\twell I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes so I didn't I didn't really do that I did cut back on my coffee a little bit but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning so you know I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups and I did take the dog for a walk but I haven't really gotten out other than that \nT:\tokay so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals you did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes you did cut down from two cups of coffee to one and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk but it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue getting out more with people \nC:\tyeah I don't I don't really like to go out with people there's usually a lot a lot of chatter a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in there \nT:\tso it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how does that make feel \nC:\tum it just makes me feel a little bit nervous and then when I get out there don't really I don't really engage in conversation \nT:\tokay so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious so I'm wondering what we could do about that \nC:\tum I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead \nT:\tthat would absolutely be one option you could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you're around \nC:\tyeah it's a good idea \nT:\tand in terms of the the yoga let's get back to the yoga format tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes \nC:\twell I just looked at my gym I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying to go to a gym and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else so that's why I didn't really look anywhere else \nT:\tmm-hmm and so if I were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ten \nC:\tmaybe about a five or six \nT:\tokay and so what made you say five or six rather than two or three\nC:\tum well I I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it so I'm interested in doing it it's just really hard\nT:\tso when you see the pictures on your newsfeed it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it it makes it yeah more challenging\nC:\twell it's it I haven't done it before so it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible as the other people \nT:\tmm-hmm and so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about civility \nC:\twell I think I think that people go to become flexible but I think that maybe some people are already just flexible \nT:\tmm-hmm so you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner\nC:\twell I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class\nT:\tokay so what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class\nC:\twell I I feel embarrassed I think and then if the teacher tried to get me to do it and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose and I think it would be embarrassing \nT:\tokay so you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses and how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class\nC:\twell I think I feel really good \nT:\tand so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class \nC:\twhy I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it \nT:\twhat what would cause you to not be able to do it with the closest or not\nC:\tI'm not sure \nT:\tokay I remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible and I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now\nC:\twell when I was a kid I used to just practice a stretch a lot and now that I don't I don't have that same flexibility\nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tso as I've gotten older I've lost a lot of flexibility \nT:\tand how would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed \nC:\tI mean it would be okay but I don't I don't like that feeling what would be the payoff \nT:\tdo you think if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment \nC:\twell I probably feel we're not a good in the end \nT:\tyou know I can give you a lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down as a matter of fact some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications so I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not \nC:\tI didn't really know that I just thought that that yoga was more about flexibility I didn't realize there were so many other benefits \nT:\tokay so how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ten\nC:\twell I probably if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine \nT:\tgood good that's a definite improvement and and you could determine after that first class whether you're levels have decreased or not and that would that be validation for you or would that be you give you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class\nC:\tI think that would be a lot of motivation\nT:\tokay to continue so one other thing that I wanted to to mention to you um was you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature \nC:\twow it was only about  minutes it was really cold and windy so we didn't want to stay out and by we I mean the dog and I\nT:\tmmm-hmm and so because of it was cold and Wendy you decided to kind of cut the walk short \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand and that's definitely understandable I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day \nC:\tWow it might help if I take a jacket next time \nT:\tokay so if you took a check in case it's gold \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be and that would help you even more enjoy it \nC:\tas long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better \nT:\tokay \nC:\tand there's lots of trails around my house like that \nT:\tokay excellent it's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise and so do you think you could commit to an hour probably and on a scale of one to ten tell me what that probably means \nC:\tum it's probably a ten I can I can to that \nT:\tokay all right so it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out play assignments towards decreasing your anxiety you really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes but you you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home how strongly do you feel about doing them at home\nC:\tif I could do them at home I would probably do them all the time \nT:\tmm-hmm I think that would be a big difference and then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses less coffee you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good and get out more with people you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space that's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space and on a scale of one to ten you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog job I think we have a plan so overall on all four of these items how motivated do you feel on a scale of one to ten \nC:\tI think it's a  I think I can do them on all four all four\nT:\tfabulous and how do you think you will feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel\nC:\tI think it but maybe even make me look forward to doing these if I were doing them on a regular basis\nT:\tmm-hmm and how would it make you feel \nC:\tI think it would make me feel really good\nT:\tand so you feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would - very good \nC:\tthank you\nT:\twe'll check in next week we'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this good job \nC:\tthank you so much  ",
  "﻿T:\tgood afternoon Bruce I'm glad you could make it in today thanks for coming in here last week when you were an you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana and so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use all together and how did you feel about our talk last week \nC:\tI was okay I guess \nT:\tyeah just okay yeah all right okay I want to refresh your memory at not godly notes here do you mind if I refer to my notes\nC:\twhat's good\nT:\toh we had developed for strategies to help you decrease the amount of marijuana if not cut it off altogether and one of the items were worlds were to run more you used to run a lot and you like to run and so we have realized that the marijuana use usage was merely a mask to self-medicate for the depression but we also know that running up serotonin and in many cases is just as good as an antidepressant so you're excited about this last week so I'm wondering how you made up with the running last week \nC:\twell it was raining out so I didn't really get around to it it was pretty cold \nT:\tso yeah yeah and so because of the rain and the coldness it kind of took away from your from your mood and your motivation to go running\nC:\tyeah I wasn't in the mood \nT:\tI'm wondering what you could have done to get in the mood\nC:\tI'm not sure what I could have done and so because of the not exercising \nT:\tdid it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week \nC:\tyeah with what i use a bit more \nT:\tokay okay so how would you tie those two things together by not running\nC:\tI think that it makes what I'm not exercising that generally I would turn to the more usage \nT:\tyeah yeah so when you reflect back now on last week and the rain coming down and it was cold I'm wondering if there's a way that you could change your perception about that such that it wouldn't stop you from running how do you think \nC:\tyeah I could probably change the perception about that maybe we're a rain jacket or something \nT:\tmm-hmm that would be a great idea that would be an excellent idea some people even think that it's fun running in the rain and the cold so that might that might absolutely be an alternative the other thing was to stay away from your friends that you would consider bad influences with using the marijuana how did you make out with that\nC:\toh I tried to stay away but I didn't I still saw some of them \nT:\tso it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life last week and can you tell me more but what was difficult about it \nC:\twell I just thought that they think something badly of the only one time to think avoiding or AZ \nT:\tso you didn't it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings three by them thinking that you were going to avoid them \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand so as a result of this what what happened\nC:\toh well I just ended up going to see them yeah \nT:\tand so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana is that correct \nC:\tyeah we did\nT:\tyeah and I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week \nC:\toh well I could I suppose I could just try or not to go in and see little guys and what would that involve trying hard or not to go see them hmm i guess it's as simple as just not going \nT:\tyeah sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment to yourself and just drawing the line and do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with \nC:\tyes yeah I do I don't see that often but I could I could go see it start to see that more\nT:\tokay how motivated on a scale one to ten would you say you are too kind of reignite friendships with people with people that don't smoke pot \nC:\tmaybe a vote of three \nT:\tokay so you're still you're still a little iffy about you what about whether you want to associate with those friends again but I have to ask you Bruce what gee what made you say three instead of one \nC:\twell because i know i have pro so i feel like i need to i think i should start doing something about it I think \nT:\tthat's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards the friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly and when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past what kind of things did you do what was your life like \nC:\toh I like with what this kind of thing is activity is insane yeah was it fun being with them yeah it was fun yeah we just mostly like doing some activities maybe just sort of get some fresh air kind of thing usually it's a not so like you know there's more they tend to do more healthy activity\nT:\tthat would say so you can recall living up healthier life than and having fun of doors and basically having the healthier life overall without using the pot \nC:\tyeah I think I think that writer it could be a might take my mind off of it\nT:\tmm-hmm sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the part because it makes you realize that you don't really need it and I think it's a great I think that's a great idea the other item on your goal whether it's a goal not an item was to get a pet how did you make out go and it was a dog you were going after a dog at the SPCA and how did you make out with that why was \nC:\tI really had a lot of second thoughts about it and I was worried about commitment and and I kind of think so I didn't feel like that was the right idea\nT:\tmm-hmm okay so you had some second thoughts about that you are excited about it in last week's session but after a chance to reflect upon it you kind of realize that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best thing for you \nC:\twell there's lark think there'd be a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to to be put in I think that's why is to recognize that right up front I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage \nT:\tI'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider\nC:\tmaybe maybe what what do you have in what I'm thinking do you like pets that are don't require such a commitment\nT:\tthat's a good idea\nC:\tI didn't think we'll that because a dog is the talk is a large commitment \nT:\tyeah there's all kinds of animals and snakes or fish or something okay snakes are fish that would definitely be a star these animals that you like \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tall right yeah I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to alright so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be asked and then from marijuana how did you make out with that \nC:\twell I looked into it but like I went to the first the first meeting and I just I felt like like those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd just I'm not where they are that place\nT:\tso you made the effort to go and you went but that was \nC:\tI couldn't I just didn't want it \nT:\tand so we you didn't say the whole time and so you left early because you felt you didn't feel in you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning\nC:\tyeah yeah \nT:\tI can definitely understand that I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you what do you think\nC:\tyeah I can see there could be some positive I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much you at this point \nT:\tmm-hmm and what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group\nC:\twhy would I would probably be able to relate to people the same kind of situation oh maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people \nT:\tso you're you're saying that the positives of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey and do have connections with other people and again I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pod but from increasing the feel-good hormones in your body the connection and the relating to other people it might be similar when you are younger you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player and so you had support that was sort of like a the team was sort of like a support group I'm wondering if you could relate to people and had connections so I'm wondering if you could see a support group as a team\nC:\tyeah it would probably be the same kind of situation like essentially people in support group for all there for the same goal so it's kind of in hockey or embrace very with their win \nT:\tmm-hmm and and do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team it's good it gave and that's because of those good feeling hormones that come and neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections so how committed do you think you are if I were to send you a list of support group so you could try out some others where there weren't the bottom of the barrel as you say there how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week \nC:\tprobably eight\nT:\tyeah wow what made you see an eighth rather than a  \nC:\twell just a team analogy i think is a good analogy \nT:\tso you thought of how you remembered you remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection \nC:\tyeah and also you know i don't have to be the mean if if he said if I think of it as a team maybe I would be like a star on the team because I'm not quite so long barrel maybe \nT:\tI love that analogy good thinking good thinking Bruce that's excellent Wow well just to summarize today you came then you had made some progress that you had some stumbling blocks um you have decided that whether it's rain or shine you're going to run anyway because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting a dog you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing ovation okay and in terms of a support group I will send you a list of support groups and you feel that on a scale of one to ten that you're about an eight and actually caring through and drying up two of these support groups because of the hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate today's session \nC:\tit was good very good \nT:\tand if we were to put it on a scale again one to ten for debate \nC:\tabout  right \nT:\twe did good that if we didn't eight glad you came in to Dave Bruce and I will see you next week and check up and we will we will see how you did with these goals and then we will move forward from there all right way to go \nC:\tthanks all right you  ",
  "﻿T:\thello Maria it's nice to see you \nC:\thello there was a good say it's nice to see you but it's never good to go to the doctor \nT:\tmmm unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment but first I'd like to check in on a few things the first is your smoking you were at a half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for you to quit I'd say it's even more important now that smoking is associated with Davey T so have you quit \nC:\tno I haven't quit \nT:\tso do you remember our conversation from our last visit that's when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist \nC:\tyes I remember but no I didn't quit and no I didn't call her \nT:\tand why is that \nC:\tI'm not ready and I'm too upset to talk about this I don't mean to be rude doctor but I've had a hard time lately and I'm not in the mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting I'll let you know when I'm ready and we can talk about it but here now today I'm here to talk about my blood clots \nT:\twell we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking I'm afraid the blood clots will return again\nC:\tlet's just talk about my treatment right now \nT:\thello Maria it's nice to see you again\nC:\thello I wish I could say it's nice to see you but it's never good to have to come to the doctor \nT:\tunfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to talk today about how to manage your blood clots and some options for treating but first I wanted to check in on your smoking status in our last visit I recommended that you begin to think about quitting and I would be interested in hearing your thoughts \nC:\twell I haven't really thought about it actually I thought about canceling this appointment because I knew you were going to bring it up again talking about smoking with me as hard for you yes it's because you're going to tell me to quit like you always do and then it feels you're just like everyone else like my caseworker the building manager everybody seems to think they know what I need to do and nobody thinks I know anything \nT:\tso when it comes to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you you you don't feel heard or respected no respect that's it \nC:\tyes \nT:\twell I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you're concerned as your provider I have to be honest and say that smoking can cause blood clots but hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking\nC:\tyeah \nT:\thaving said that I know my opinion is not the deciding factor quitting smoking as a decision only you can make \nC:\twell I'm really glad I came into I have to get this blood clot condition under control\nT:\tI know that would it be okay with you if I share some information about smoking and blood clots and I can tell you what I know and then we'll see what you think\nC:\tyes I don't know that I will quit but I will listen   \nT:\tso what do you think\nC:\tI always thought that the blood clots came from my mother hello like passed down like genetics I didn't know that smoking could cause this I just thought that blood clots run in my family I guess I also didn't get how dangerous this clotting \nT:\tcan be you seem surprised and a little more aware now the smoking risks I guess so yes so Maria I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking so on a scale of one to ten with one being you don't think it is at all important that you quit and ten being you're ready to quit today where would you put yourself \nC:\twell if you had asked me when I first came in i would have said less than one \nT:\tbut now i would have to say for why a four and not a lower number \nC:\tthat's a good question let me think about it um I guess it's a four because of the blood clots the blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now \nT:\tso having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots increases your desire to quit or little \nC:\tyes\nT:\twhat else if anything makes quitting important to you \nC:\tyou know the bigger thing for me is the fear of being evicted from my apartment there's a rule that we can't smoke in the house and I stick to it for the most part but the other day I smoked out the window and that was only the second time I've done it but don't you know the building manager caught me so now i am sure she's going to be watching me even more I can't lose my apartment \nT:\tthe possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you in addition to your health \nC:\tI would hate to think that my son t and they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over a biting by a stupid code even if I hate that rule I smoked when I was pregnant with them and thank you Holy Mother they were born healthy I don't think I could live with myself if they lost their home because of something I'm doing \nT:\tso it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children it's obvious that you're a good mom and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear \nT:\tso let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to  how would you rate your confidence to quit \nC:\tOh confidence oh I'd have to stay at two so you are not feeling very confident right now hello no not confident at all I mean I've tried to quit so many times and I just can't do it\nT:\tso you've been persistent in trying and haven't been successful yet still you you said a two and not a one I'm curious about that \nC:\twell the only reason I said her too is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with santhi and they or both I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale and I didn't make it past that and that was really mad at myself for that I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed I guess I'm just hopeless I mean who keeps smoking when there's a baby inside \nT:\tit sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down and that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids \nC:\tyes and I'm doing it again right now by not following the rules I'm addicted to cigarettes just like a drug addict in the end the cigarettes always win \nT:\tso what what do you think sante and thao think about your smoking \nC:\tmmm Southee yells at me and sometimes they'll cries when I go out to smoke he says mama smoking is bad \nT:\tso you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit if you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction if you believed you could do it you would \nC:\tI'd like to think so but I just don't think I can do it \nT:\tyou quit for two months when you were pregnant with Te'o how did you do it then \nC:\tI don't know and I just did it I fought the urges with sucking on straws and some hard candies said I just did it\nT:\twow so you were able to quit on your own for two months that's impressive have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups \nC:\tmmm no I think people can quit if they really want to I'm just too weak \nT:\tah wow you must be pretty hard on yourself what would you say if I told you that very few people only four percent of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey no really is that true hmm yes and and most people try many times before their successful their medications and groups yet and I'd be happy to share that information with you I'd like to help you if that's something that you'd like\nC:\twell I don't know I'm let me think about it can you give me the information again the booklets that brochure you gave me before I didn't want to tell you but I threw them away when I got home but i really want to read them this time \nT:\tthat's great maria you can look them over and i'll have our tobacco treatment specialist sonya follow up with you we have an excellent tobacco treatment program here and I am I believe that Sonya can help you quit when you're ready okay what one would be a good time to check back in she can call me next week and I'll let you know I may be ready to try again absolutely and I'll have Sonya

  "﻿T:\tgreat session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged right so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule \nC:\tokay \nT:\tthis will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording better back pain did not return okay so before we do this I'd like to re-explore why you saw no physical therapy in the first place ok this is sound okay to you \nC:\tyeah it does you know the you know ever since the new year I've been trying to get back into you know being more active than playing basketball and all that stuff but I've been seems like I'm hitting a wall quite a bit okay I have a lot of obstacles and having trouble getting through it okay\nT:\twell tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way \nC:\tso as you as you know my body's been playing you know basketball pick up and I've been trying to do trying to do that and that's caused me some back pain in the past and it's been a struggle for me to do that so I went the doctor and the doctor gave me some some pain medication and the pain medication worked for for a while but it seemed like it didn't really take care of it so then I started I try I try to try to do basketball again but then I had more pain from that so I'm really stuck with with going back to basketball because of the pain \nT:\twell it sounds like you really struggled it back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and then SAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life \nC:\twell I have been trying to eat better but it's been quite difficult to maintain for a pro for a long period of time work is getting busier and I'm getting closer to about six hours a night but sleep things definitely isn't the best for me you know I feel much better when I'm exercising but when this back pain calm down everything just seems to fall apart and definitely makes me less active \nT:\twell you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active \nC:\tyeah I did I definitely felt a lot better felt like I was like turning a new chapter in my life and I'd like to thank that I was being more proactive about my health \nT:\tokay well it sounds like you realize that when you started with change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring go to back pain in the first place \nC:\tI don't think I was in the proper physical shape to be playing basketball with my friends you know I said I'd up at a desk for about eight hours a day and I go from there to play in basketball the rest and the medications did have some positive effects initially but it seemed like they were not helping overall yes a pain came right back\nT:\tI think I think your life you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a threat and that something needs to change there are many other things I played two white pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pickup basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you \nC:\tyes I definitely think so I mean working eight hours a day and going to play basketball my body\nT:\twe're not ready for them definitely you know because many factors influence pain we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but i think that the physical capability of your body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and i think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that \nC:\twell i definitely understand that you know i really have an exercise in a couple of years and because everything's been pretty crazy at home very hectic lots of hours at home doing work the kids have been busy things that in the job is very busy just hectic I thought playing basketball be great for me I think it is but I definitely wasn't ready to step right back in and then didn't realize my body needed more more preparedness to give into that program \nT:\tyou have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects start a company that \nC:\twell I guess I could go for short walks with my wife after work definitely be less stress on my body and be some type of exercise for me in terms of work it would make sense if I got up once in a while from my chair and just walk around I think that would be it would make sense and it'd be good for me \nT:\tgreat it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know with start with walking let your body adapt as you've been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health \nC:\tyeah certainly I definitely feel that consistency is important untie I'm tired of starting and stopping starting and stopping I definitely want to be more consistent \nT:\tbrilliance you've got the consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise \nC:\twell my wife walks four or five times a week in each time she walks is about  minutes I could probably do that also I work I think i could get up and walk around every up at least once every hour\nT:\tit sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of  to   being not confident at all and  being one hundred percent confident how confident are you that you would be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime \nC:\tI would probably say about a six or seven \nT:\twell you're not a zero that tells me you've got some conference in making a change let me ask you why are you confident \nC:\tyou know as I said before I'm tired of starting stopping and I'm just tired that and I also i think i could lose i could use to lose a few pounds \nT:\tokay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving mores work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively \nC:\tyes I definitely think so \nT:\tbut you're not a  that tells me that there may be some obstacles your success what would it take for you to be a  or even eight or nine\nC:\ti think if i get my my whole family involved that will certainly helped also if i can set you know small realistic goals for myself i think that will keep keep me motivated you know in the past you know let me talk about a few times already that you know I'm always stopping and starting I think if I if I do those things I won't i won't do that and also i think that i'll stay more motivated and there to help you probably lead myself to better healthier lifestyle \nT:\tbrilliant i get the impression that you want to stay on course and starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain the best way to do this is as we said staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated you know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside during this progression it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road as of a bill conference and increases strength and resiliency of your body so if I saw you in two weeks what would you tell me with regards to hell your new exercise regime is going \nC:\tI will tell you that I'm consistent I will tell you I'm feeling much better I'll tell you I would probably have little pain if any i'll tell you a more active in an overall just tell you i'm very healthy \nT:\tgood good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from  to  he'll conference are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime\nC:\tdefinitely attend definitely i agree you know overall most comments in your brain\nT:\tlet's see you in two weeks crazy idea\nC:\tokay perfect thank you no problem  ",
  "﻿T:\tthis week it's really good to see you again how you feeling about where we talked about last week developed or maybe because some changes not do you or I kind of waking up p or need to change inside of you how's it going?\nC:\twell there's a lot going on with the court stuff that I got going on and you know looking at possible jail time and you know talking with my lawyer and with that you know it's just really stressful and it makes me want to drink again and i know i shouldn't but just you know all this stress with everything that's going on you know that's the only way I you know I if I could just have like you know maybe a glass of wine or something that might help me feel better and understand things but I also know that I was you know that's kind of what got me into this situation you know I was out with my friends and I had like eight glasses of wine and tried to drive home so I know that I shouldn't be doing it so I'm kind of you know I know the difference I know I should be going you know working out but it's still it's easier just to have a glass of wine and you know just try to think things out that way \nT:\tso you're realizing all these things that are ramifications of the DUI are really positive stress wants or trigger you to drink but at the same time you really realize this is something you probably shouldn't do and that's ultimately important to you\nC:\tyes I you know I can since we talked the last time I can definitely see you know how my drinking has kind of led up to where I'm at now and you know that maybe there's different ways that I can deal with things instead of just wanting to have a drink \nT:\tmm-hmm that's so good good insight and it sounds like you're still kind of on the fence um we do permission I'd like to ask if I could possibly use a tool that's worked pretty well for some other books it's called a decisional balance scale and it sort of helps you weigh out both sides of the issue so eun hye fellow a more comfortable and privacy explore reasons to change and what would happen if you didn't if you did change and then also reasons for not changing what what happened if you get that is that something with you willing to do today\nC:\tyeah I mean we can look at that I do it kind of in my head anyway so I'm getting it out on paper would give me a visual to kind of wrestling back to\nT:\tokay are you comfortable writing or would you prefer me to \nC:\tI um I can write\nT:\tok so let's start what about reasons to change what's going on \nC:\tum reasons to change what we could be you know just spiritually and physically a healthier person \nT:\tokay what does that mean\nC:\twhen I'm drinking I don't feel like I want to go to church or you know connect with other people who don't drink so you know I kind of lost that ambition to you know want to be around people who aren't drinking so it would get me back into their social groups\nT:\tgood so to open up your social atmosphere baby \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tthat's more of a positive influence and something that's sort of you know makes you fit in but doesn't necessarily make you feel good about yourself \nC:\tyes you know and I've lost that one less for five years \nT:\tokay anything else do you like bad\nC:\tum I think I would be able to you know be a better role model for people if I was you know if I could change even my drinking I would be able to you know be making an inspiration to others \nT:\tso that would be a positive okay you like to give back some of this experience \nC:\tyeah just in that sense is that I've you know a lot of family members drinks so I think you know maybe if I quit or if I could you know where's the skills that maybe you know with that I could help other people my family \nT:\tso maybe breaking the cycle of what's happened to you for \nC:\tyeah yeah\nT:\tthat would be a positive spoons of a very good husband and some reason it would be really truly meaningful to that spiritual side you mentioned before \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay um anything else before we want to kind of what can happen if you do change know that that's a good that's a good cap solution okay so if you do these things what do you think is going to kind of an outcome just to kind of sum up we have said \nC:\tI think I would um I would be a more of a leader than inspiration as in people \nT:\tokay your family members maybe people in a you really want to be anything \nC:\tyeah I do I mean I've seen other people you not to talk with you and you know other people have shown me how it would be or how fulfilling it would be if I you know inspire some change within myself and if i do that i would like to give back\nT:\tso your associate for fulfillment throughout this process \nC:\tyeah some sort of you know learning experience something take away from what's happened \nT:\tokay very good things anything else that you feel like maybe these things you'll do you mention kind of some legal stuff over here is there anything that you want to add about that here or is that not important \nC:\ti think if i change I would get I would be out of the legal system you know I don't want to be on probation I don't want to be paying these fines if they take a lot for my schooling my work you know my my family life so being done with that legal aspect would be something that I would definitely look forward to \nT:\tokay just being able to get back to your life of things that you know \nC:\tyeah I run to you i don't know like work like family yeah because it's you know I've not a high-risk insurance I have to go do extra meetings and go the group panels and it's just you know this is all added so much more to my life guess it's not that you're not very excited about something no and but i do want to take it as a learning experience so I don't want it to have to do this again \nT:\tokay so you want to get a learning experience out of it yes all right anything else you want to add this box or should we can review what you wrote \nC:\tthat's yeah that's reviewing okay I don't remember one already \nT:\tso just to kind of sum up you talk first about reasons not to change is that's kind of where your abs and then we also talked about reasons to change in this kind of writing won't go that was like so you mentioned that you the reasons you might not want changes it doesn't make you feel better when you're stressed out to drink it relaxes you it makes me feel like you can handle things yes um they're also keeps your same social Farrah social sphere of people that you trust and that you enjoyed spending time with and it gives you a way to fit in with those people \nC:\tyeah and that's you know it's where i'm at right now on this i feel and people i like to be around \nT:\tand you're comfortable there\nC:\tyes \nT:\tokay um the results of not changing your brought out for that if things were to keep going the same way they are that you might get in more legal trouble especially after you have more serious but on the flip side you'd also keep the fence and filling them up don't worry about trying to be that change in the waters \nC:\tyeah ok I'm going to the next side that sounds right\nT:\tand you mentioned that if you did change that you would feel like you're more spiritually and physically healthier which meant having a more open social clear positive people to you \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tand then you would be a better inspiration to others and that you might break the cycles in the family issues the patent paths that you've sort of perpetuating right now yeah underneath you feel a little uncertain about your going forward and and then if you did those things that you would feel you more a leader and inspiration to people around you and not really meant to you've been example to others in searching with them fulfillment in this process here you'd also mention that you would get a legal system you know you would have fines be done with all that stuff and not have any of the added pressures that being in the legal system puts on you yes and then you really get a learning experience out of the situation you can really apply for other things in your life \nC:\tI would I think I will you know once this is all over with you know hopefully I'll look back and be like that was something that I did and I did\nT:\twonderful  ",
  "﻿T:\twere hoping to discuss today the pain in my ribs is still too much for me every time every time I take a deep breath or even just bend down to know feed my dog or something it's miserable\nT:\tsounds like you've been in a lot of pain and it's made it pretty difficult to do some of the things you normally do so tell me a little bit about your routine and and what your pain is like \nC:\twell I used to be able to go outside no jog around I play some sports and my friends every so often but I can't do anything now besides just lay in my bed \nT:\tsounds like you're really acted before and this pain is really causing a lot of problems for you if you would rate your pain on a scale of  to  where would you say your level is\nC:\ton average seven and eight usually sometimes less sometimes more\nT:\tokay so pretty high levels of pain\nC:\tyeah and nothing makes it better except when I take oxy and smoke some weed \nT:\twhat kinds of things have you been doing to manage your pain \nC:\toh that's taking the oxy you prescribed and smoking some weed you know every now and then again to just ease the pain \nT:\tokay so you you're taking the oxy you're smoking some weed can you tell me a little bit how you been taking your medications and how often you're smoking \nC:\tI mean I'm taking the oxy just as you prescribed one every four hours just the bottle says smoke weed maybe three or four times a day just take the edge off what other kinds of things have you been trying to manage your pain right now there was the hot and cold treatment but I just felt like a waste of time so did the topical cream is just a waste of money \nT:\tok so the hot and cold didn't seem to work the topical cream didn't seem to work and it sounds like you've been taking the axion smoking some weed and that's been a little bit helpful tell me what else you've tried for your pain nothing else besides that really like \nC:\ti said the oxy and the weed it's hard for me to it was hard for me to even to walk here \nT:\tnow i'm curious if you had a magic wand and you were able to wake up tomorrow and your life was different what would it look like \nC:\tI'd be outside again playing sports and my friends just enjoying life getting back to the things that just haven't been able to do \nT:\tSteven I think those are really great goals and I think those are things we need to be working towards and as your doctor I also need to share with you that I'm concerned that you're still on the oxycodone six months out from your injury six months really isn't that long\nC:\tand i'm still in pain and I mean if I wasn't in pain I wouldn't be taking it you know it's your it's your prescription I don't I don't know what else to do I need relief \nT:\twell I'm not trying to push you but I do think it's important for us to think about pain management that is not going to cause you more problems and it's going to allow you to get back to the lifestyle that you really want to be living what kinds of things do you think would be helpful \nC:\tI really don't know I am out of ideas \nT:\tokay\nC:\tit's not my fault I'm in this much pain you should have known if I was going to get addicted \nT:\twhy didn't you tell me \nC:\twell and I'm sorry\nT:\tStephen I don't mean to be pushing you but I do want to talk about maybe what the the next steps would be to be helpful for you \nC:\twell if you have any recommendations i'd be willing to hear\nT:\ti think it's really important that we choose a plan that you feel like you're able to do that works with you and you feel capable of following through with now thinking about what you've done already what do you feel like would be helpful at this point\nC:\treally anything that keeps me out of the pain I mean would you have any recommendations I'd be glad to hear them \nT:\tgreat i do i'd actually love to share some information with you from the Center for Disease Control they have some guidelines about how we approach pain management in situations like this would it be okay if I talk with you about that \nC:\tyeah yes okay\nT:\tso what the the guidelines do say is that for people who have had injuries like yours but we want to be using prescription pain medications in a certain period of time where it's effective and that tends to be six weeks so we're beyond that at this point now from that point what we like to do is transition you to over-the-counter medication so taper off the oxy and go to things like tylenol a leave and motrin and do that in combination with some holistic therapies like we've talked about before you know when people are on the oxy for longer than six months we put you at risk for some opiate dependence and some other health concerns\nC:\tI think that what would make sense \nT:\tat this point is to think about transitioning you off of the oxy onto one of these over-the-counter medications and using some of these other techniques to help you manage the pain what do you think about those guidelines and maybe that plan\nC:\tI I could agree with them it's just this holistic therapies you talked about require a lot of movement and without that pain relief i don't know how i would get through it \nT:\tyeah i hear that it's scary to to maybe do anything that might increase your pain that makes a lot of sense and i'm not opposed to prescribing you some some other medications for pain but as your medical provider i also have to say that I don't think smoking marijuana is the best means to manage your pain right now and I'm wondering what you think about making some of these changes \nC:\tyeah i'd be willing to try anything to get rid of this pain if you really think that's the best option then i will listen to you \nT:\ti do and i think we need to think about what you're willing to do what you're able to do and what you feel like you can do most consistently so it sounds like at this point we're thinking about tapering off the oxy getting you on to something like tylenol and doing some exercise that you feel like you can do how do you feel about this plan \nC:\ti'd be willing to try the holistic exercises you were talking about taking tylenol but if I'm in pain that I'm going to call you absolutely \nT:\tand I want you to call me and I think it actually makes sense for us to set a time within the next week for us to talk maybe do a phone check in and see how you're doing and even if you're not doing any better and then we can take it from there and see what changes we need to make to the plan\nC:\tgreat \nT:\twell I have to say I'm really glad that you came in and I think it's very courageous to take the step and facing some of this pain as well to get you back to the life that you really want to be living right now so I thank you for coming in and I'll see you I'll  ",

marijuana \nT:\thow come on marijuana how recently was this do you like about we could uh okay so what's been going on what happens\nC:\tum well I am gonna have to go to course there and I know that are probably going to have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so are just I'm just coming here because I know maybe I can like get out of it from getting some type of treatment but oh yeah get out of it\nT:\tyou mean get a discharge?\nC:\tyeah I mean I feel like they're probably going to make me like go to rehab or something like that I'll want to do that \nT:\tso you feel like you can get out of the rehab are too \nC:\tum I don't know I really am not sure i just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make a change in terms not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life \nT:\talright so with this recent arrest we realize it may be value to stop using the joy don't want to \nC:\tmmhmm yeah \nT:\tso you're stuck there \nC:\tyeah kind of like I was like realize that like drinking into you marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know it just that's all I do usually employed an exam or like\nT:\tfeel better when you drink you ever socialize at the same time\nC:\tI mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most times just like that I have alone city of the marijuana yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself I'm a smoke everyday \nT:\tso thought it was what people are doing it so does it sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using not really so what are you losing \nC:\tI kind of just like to use it to like cope i got like i have a brain injury that i got like a while ago and like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seems to help once after an injury this is alcohol marijuana \nT:\tso you take it for pain relief equalities \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tany other reasons? \nC:\tum it's just easier it's just the marijuana leaf relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when i'm using forget about problems yeah \nT:\tso it affects your mood in a positive way \nC:\tyeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once i'm drunk and then if i'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I'll have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings \nT:\thave you used since you had to do you \nC:\tI um I haven't drank but I looked like I cut back on my smoking a little bit but i'm still using alright in a bit of a situation \nT:\talright so you have the use that takes away pain for you \nC:\tit takes my anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law yeah how do you figure those two things out I don't know I don't know if there's always see your wholesome hours no like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking on using marijuana he had imagined all right \nT:\tso you can't imagine that so is look at the other side can you imagine having further instance with law enforcement we're charges in the future\nC:\tif I hadn't really sort of that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible to not get any more charges or anything like that not be in the situation again\nT:\tso you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence and you'll be more careful in the future\nC:\tI don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just working like right before try to like avoid that situation again \nT:\tso with that thinking you continue to use as you were that you take out the part that got you in trouble\nC:\tyeah \nT:\tthe first you have to get out of trouble this time yep so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it\nC:\tI just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I took mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like it's my friends called me up and said hey you would want to go out tonight like not drinking with them \nT:\tso there's a social component here \nC:\tyeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like  jobs they dont trick every day but I do but like on the weekend things like all my friends who I do have it all to drink\nT:\talright so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends mm-hmm how would they respond if you went out with them\nC:\tI didn't drink um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out and we got like really drunken I would just feel like ass please so it'd be socially awkward yeah straining the relationships with your friends \nT:\tso the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good rap for you know but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second guess some of it \nC:\tyeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change of making \nT:\tso you need to make some change \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tbut not the alcohol and drugs \nC:\tyeah alcohaulin I want something else could change yeah I don't know what \nT:\tbut you have any theories \nC:\tum I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's literally got me into situation that was other than that not really and I really never thought of what I could do \nT:\tso you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the name \nC:\tI might just not go anywhere ever I'm not sure drivers often because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel\nT:\tokay so that strategy might not work that's something you've been tossed around though this ideas isolate a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of ground yeah that just such as mayor's it seemed that way to you too now that I'm like talking through it\nC:\tyeah as I don't think I have any choice really you know of any choice what's gonna happen is going to happen I don't know \nT:\toh really oh alright so what store do we know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the deal I what do you think you could do that would make a bad impression \nC:\tgo to court strong test positive as I get drug tested that would do it get another DUI in the meantime I would look good either\nT:\talright so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want to do those things would it be acceptable to do this thing's anyone\nC:\tI mean not really i mean i think i could avoid the knowledge drunk driving enough or maybe not to wreck the day of my court date but I don't know about the holy SH marijuana part tougher \nT:\tyeah all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going the court chug yeah goals that you could get behind home come in \nC:\tI can try I guess to like think about it and try to get out I know I'm going to stress out the day of my court date \nT:\twell it's gonna be hard to like not turn that day you're not striking me is overly enthusiastic about this idea this is this is really tough for you if the alcohol in the marijuana that are important to you yeah this hold this so do you I think it's really just encroached on somebody at going on that you enjoyed yeah so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does that change things \nC:\tI don't know because I don't know any other like way around it centered dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to quarter into that's going to warrant out for me I can't it can't wait this situation \nT:\twhat if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in the more marijuana period like it's either that you obey those rules or or jail now so they wouldn't get to that\nC:\tI know it possibly could it's probably well but i don't know i would think it all certainly would ya yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I was like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when i get home for the next day or the next day let's go back a couple of steps\nT:\thow long have you been used in the alcohol marijuana\nC:\tfor about like six years six years \nT:\thave ever until now with the DUI have you ever envision stopping know what's your plan like pre do you i will is your plan in all this\nC:\tI just kinda like the drinking kind of has gotten worse wasn't always that bad if only g marijuana but the alcohol i guess i've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really expected my life too much but i guess the alcohol has been a little bit more \nT:\tyeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah weird years to come\nC:\tyeah I didn't really have any like I never liked thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or this home now yeah could this be in a strange way like an opportunity I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop\nT:\tif you really wanted to stop could you stop \nC:\tI don't know magus I could try but I don't have the one \nT:\tyou could give a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it \nC:\tyeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know it's just unknown yeah \nT:\tyeah so what do you want to go from here you have this to you I I imagine a hearing some time coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you \nC:\tI guess yes help me figure out whether or not like i do want to stop trickier ease and ROK's I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to don't know if I could like get to a place where i actually \nT:\tyou want to stop it be easier to actually do it then like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tokay do you want to work on that\nC:\tyeah I think that'd be good\nT:\talright so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up no they're not for like a few more weeks few more weeks hi so I'll see you again and I have the iop and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just slumming now okay thanks Mel B \nC:\tthank you  ",

  "﻿T:\twell seen my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits and I don't see what the big problem is \nT:\tyou've been working real hard \nC:\tsometimes I can't come home for dinner so I'm having a lot of you a police or someone like that she seemed to have a problem or don't see the big deal \nT:\tokay and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning to you right now and about that \nC:\tI've definitely done my work is really manual labor intensive so I'm usually working it out and in Ostend the gorge of the day so he was sweating out any like bad things up in my system \nT:\tso okay have you noticed putting on any weight a little bit but nothing too blue okay okay and how about hope to see his doctor have you gone to visit a bit of dark driving last year for physical but being everything showed up to be following that you feel good you feel good okay that's what I hear is that you you feel like your wife might be overreacting to this \nC:\twell minato really over right no no no she was being a no-shoe \nT:\tshe wants for you to live a long time and be healthy but it's sometimes special you work hard \nC:\ton when I kind of going out to eat these places kind of in a little bit better better situations\nT:\tsure sure okay um and so one thing I just like to do is maybe give you some information on baby obesity or diabetes that you're interested or open to that at your shirt\nC:\tso I guess the issue is that you know my doctor seems to think that my blood pressure was a little high but I really don't think that there's a problem and you know I eat really well and you know she suggested that I watch my caffeine but really caffeine is not a problem for me \nT:\tokay but we were talking a little bit earlier earlier in our conversation you had said that you didn't feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation so it's a little bit of\nC:\tI'm not sure \nT:\tso where are we did did you do you feel like you do have some agitation on the coffee or is it just no problem at all\nC:\twell you know sometimes it makes me a little jittery and you don't have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers but and working in the hospital they don't really look so highly on a good bathroom frequently but you know it keeps me awake it keeps me aware it makes me more able to like you do my job better and so I really don't see that it's a real issue I mean maybe my blood pressure is a little high but yeah so let me see about half this \nT:\tso you see you got some positives the awareness and if you feel kind of on your game and then there's some negatives with you know your coworkers that they don't you know that your boss may not want you you know check it out the hospital floor for yeah yeah and then the blood pressure thing is that sound about right \nC:\tyeah yeah well you know and sometimes like I said it does kind of make me a little jittery and I'm not not use relax but you know I really like it and like I said it makes me more aware what's going on and I feel like I'm much more observant\nT:\tyeah how about frequency if you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking \nC:\tyeah about four cups a day\nT:\tokay that feels about right to you \nC:\tyeah I mean I'd I mean the co-workers that work at night gosh they bring in a carafe\nT:\tyeah what would happen if you if you looked at maybe reducing that with that habit would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic the number yeah yeah but you're training for a day you're probably have that morning cup\nC:\tI really you know I really like waking up and that whole ritual so I definitely don't want to get that up I gotcha okay so that was important yeah and then of course you know working a -hour shift I really think that you know the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is a really good idea too I can probably give up the mid-morning\nT:\tthat's great yeah yeah I think so so you've identified one of the four that might you might be willing to to try for a while to let go of what do you what do you think of that sounds alright so you're sick of this \nC:\tyeah I I can't shoplift anymore and I got I got cold again and you know I think I suspended got back to the school so I'm gonna mess up my whole life here unless I can stop this yeah it's bad my friends and I we just it's fun and so I don't know what to do but I gotta change my morning so it sounds like you're ready you're ready to give this up yeah but maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear right I don't know what I'm going to do I got some friends these guys are they're bad news but they're my friends and it's fun so you know nothing much else going on that's as fun as this doing we still we see these and was working at farm thanks for coming back in I know last time we talked about maybe going out and joining some activities in the community look I'm meeting some people \nT:\tso then you could tell me about how that's going why didn't do anything yet \nC:\tI didn't go I know I was going to go but I didn't but I did look at there's the YMCA they've got some classes that I think will being pretty cool to go to and then there's a yoga class over the Women's Center it's only like  bucks so I could do that but I can go to really afraid that like worth you know what human likes me more my friends \nT:\tyeah I know you've mentioned that in the past when we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities you really mentioned anxiety it's a big column \nC:\tyeah but I'm gonna do it anyway because this is what I need to do to make to make friends hook up to make a change they have one for sometime\nT:\tpretty good it's been three months now since you used it's been three months\nC:\tand I've been doing pretty well and I met a couple new friends - \nT:\tso how last time we talked to you

tried to call me as well and I haven't answered the phone so it's been good for me to just reach out like me a couple new people and neighborhoods I'm living in \nT:\tso sounds like you made some good changes changing your environment and some your behaviors and these new friends\nC:\tyeah the new friends and I've been using the you know the breathing exercises you taught me when I get starting to feel a little stressed out I've been using those and it helps me I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises and it calms me down and kind of  ",
  "﻿T:\twanted to talk to you um you know you're one of our star athletes really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there and so I went to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now okay\nC:\tOh actually could i confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents are like they keep me very like it kept down out of the lake so like social life and I all about a month ago my friends invited me to a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework am always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me too late to promise her no alcohol no drugs men i'll pick you up by  and i was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come help figure out to delay her call me premium later so later so she promised she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then the time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and \nT:\tthat's exactly what I did so here you are you're an honor student your star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month some time you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence \nC:\tright like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards school work I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying i'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can i get alcohol based on their age \nT:\tand stuff like that it's really changed your focus\nC:\tyeah \nT:\twhat do you like about drinking \nC:\tI don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like in like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily in our way just so helps you kind of produce to not feel more relaxed exactly \nT:\tsounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe China any other things just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people than hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now a little bit because not all of them are into that \nC:\tso like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person that's in another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before \nT:\tokay as they are there for me well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom right where do you think you should kind of go from here \nC:\toh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tit's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little I guess may seem to other people I created \nT:\tit it's a big thing your mom is really important to you of course and how she feels about you is important how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit a lot \nC:\tat this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too I feel that there's a feature in that \nT:\thow confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit \nC:\tI'm pretty confident especially \nT:\ton a scale of one to ten where one is not at all antennas completely what number\nC:\tprobably like an  and I can't be a ton just nothing's a  in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to \nT:\twhy'd you say eight or nine rather than six or seven\nC:\tbecause I don't know I feel to turn to determine to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after i betray my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience that it's not something that I wish to enjoy so I even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking \nT:\tall right what do you think is a realistic goal for you then\nC:\tto make sure i have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if i have time i have read your time like oh i'll go party with my friends and just be as I party but that doesn't mean I have to drink and I do  cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that \nT:\tI prefer just make sure your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most exact Lee just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there is alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum\nC:\tsounds like something that'll work for you and thank you for listening listening to me my Lots me \nT:\tyeah it's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I better hurry up and get changed for practice  ",
  "﻿T:\tso how are you today \nC:\tnot bad I guess thanks \nT:\tpretty good actually added well let me introduce myself properly mines colon I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients or thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you Bob what name would you prefer mr. Jones\nC:\tno no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so much anything and it is um \nT:\tso okay like see you're a coach or something like that or\nC:\twell you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that oh but sure thinking about as a coach bird would help \nT:\tyeah so I wanted to get started if as a few things we just lay out before we get going yeah so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and i do want to point out that anything that you say to rise will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly i do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that it sounds as though you rather pin yourself at risk imminent risk are putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that okay is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about\nC:\tno \nT:\tI i understand it sounds good i mean i understand so yeah yeah well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone boomer and doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you like what brings you here well\nC:\tum I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of got myself into some trouble because because of that to tell me more about well I'm sorry i've ever been nervous sir sure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this yeah um okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome \nT:\twell quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting irritable we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities so some work opportunities \nC:\twell yeah um yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well honey my wife gets upset about that and Dicky \nT:\tso could you tell me more you've been partying your wife's being an upset with you well going on \nC:\twell the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of a little bit down because that and I thought you know my friends been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much \nT:\tso you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much\nC:\tyeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you i've been i've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and kind back on the cold \nT:\twell you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not a bit missing job opportunities you've talked about and be getting irritable and the noticing you had been different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more part in a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today athan what would be good for you to talk about now \nC:\twell I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control out of control yeah I know some people that are worse than me but thinking of it worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold hard things um I guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke in and \nT:\twell okay \nC:\tI'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the back seat and the driver done kind of the same thing you made then some coke and some booze and and it was is is pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so so good sliding is very scary yeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day and I don't even know where I was I mean and I don't even remember so it's not remembering it I must be scary to it to not remember things yeah I guess not remembering is has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and you know yes this is going to sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them \nT:\tso so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested it from Europe for your copious so you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you \nC:\tyeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really going to regret\nT:\tyour family your wife your friends are all really important to you \nC:\tvery very important \nT:\tthinking about importance Nathan how important it be for you to make changes to your core cues\nC:\twell I mean eight I don't know it you know eight out of ten if that's you know that makes a lot of sense \nT:\tyeah it's good to use imaginary scales absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and deal with people yeah okay yeah so you're roughly eight \nC:\tyeah\nT:\tI mean it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let see a four\nC:\twell I guess because it's been big causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and and\nT:\tso sorry it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you to to think about changing \nC:\tyeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tand I'm because it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow you'll resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine \nT:\tso and certainly our labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what what what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work \nC:\tI I'll be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read it a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that\nT:\tand I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it \nT:\tWow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that it's surprising well you know see the thing is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and\nT:\twow what else do you make of it\nC:\twell I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and ain't gonna be the beer \nT:\tI guess so for you if you were to stop one it'd be the cocaine it's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine makes like you say they doing and all that so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you \nC:\tbut I was\nT:\thow confident you are and I may be again in an imaginary scale of  to  where  is the most confident one is the least confident \nC:\twell I mean I'll be honest yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe  maybe maybe five four are like yeah for \nT:\tso there's somewhat competent then I wonder whites for and let's see no a one \nC:\tI sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess \nT:\tso a lot of your your friends use and it could be quite tempt and you're sure you could stop \nC:\twell yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them \nT:\tI suppose there are some things you could do to help yourself stop then\nC:\tyeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available and \nT:\tthese are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I Anna certainly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to stop I'm i did mention earlier that i had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us two million if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions how would that feel for you that work \nC:\tokay \nT:\tyeah that's okay yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly become concerned about your recent years as you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some finished off at risks and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which i guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you  "
