  "T:\thi Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you\nC:\talright\nT:\tokay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself\nC:\tokay um my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school\nT:\tokay and what do you like to do for fun\nC:\tmostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends things like that\nT:\tand when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to ball games go to party\nC:\tif it's school related maybe like a game or two or go to the mall like to shop or go to the movies or something and that night maybe like a party or something someone's throwing\nT:\tokay and what kind of hobbies do you have\nC:\tum I like to be and I like to go outside and like take walks and like hike and stuff I'm very outdoorsy so oh cool\nT:\twhat are your plans for after high school\nC:\twell I plan to apply to college and maybe you know have a good career and something like that hopefully\nT:\tthat's great what do you think you'll study\nC:\twell I'm I'm looking at the journalism maybe pre-law\nT:\tOh neat\nC:\twhich is a little different but\nT:\tyeah that's great that's a really good goal\nC:\tyeah thanks\nT:\tit's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get\nC:\tI'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's so we're pretty good okay\nT:\tokay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in\nC:\tum I think all my grades raisin B's\nT:\toh\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay and do you know where you're going to apply to college\nC:\tI'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something\nT:\tokay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism\nC:\tum well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so\nT:\tokay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol\nC:\tum not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most\nT:\tokay and how often do you think you drink\nC:\tum maybe like once or twice a month at the most\nT:\tmm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year\nC:\tpossibly yeah\nT:\tso that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then\nC:\tyeah I guess you can say that\nT:\tokay what do you thinks the most you've ever had\nC:\tum just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all so\nT:\tbut you've been drunk before\nC:\tum no not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk\nT:\tokay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol\nC:\tum yeah yeah\nT:\tokay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done\nC:\tnever drunk driven and I've never got in the car with a drunk driver\nT:\tokay how much do your friends drink\nC:\tum I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that\nT:\tokay\nC:\tdrink a lot more\nT:\twhat about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot\nC:\tyeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you\nT:\tand do you hang out with them\nC:\tnot really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine\nT:\tmm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that\nC:\tum yeah that make sense\nT:\tyeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that\nC:\tyeah yeah I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much so\nT:\tand then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that\nC:\tyeah definitely\nT:\tbut you're still drinking\nC:\tyeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so\nT:\tso I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney\nC:\tum definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of\nT:\tokay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer\nC:\tokay\nT:\tum obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that\nC:\tI definitely agree I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned like health-wise and things like that so I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing\nT:\tso do you think you can quit\nC:\tum yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life so\nT:\tokay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then\nC:\tyeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink\nT:\tokay and then what about your friends who are still drinking\nC:\tum I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will\nT:\tokay and what if they won't\nC:\twell then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything\nT:\tyeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence\nC:\tokay yeah\nT:\tand then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol\nC:\tokay yeah definitely\nT:\tokay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking\nC:\tthey would be pretty upset yeah they don't really condone alcohol use oh\nT:\tokay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here\nC:\tno I think I'm good\nT:\tokay um any questions or\nC:\tno no\nT:\tokay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in\nC:\tokay thanks\n",

  "T:\tall right Chris so I need to talk to you because as you know we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend and from what I hear where you were there and you know I can't confirm or deny anything so I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences but I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you know you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams\nC:\tall right actually I do want to speak to you about something to happen during this past weekend usually as you know I'm I'm gonna honor student I usually I'm studying over the weekend my parents to let me go out to parties but I kind of used that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to and when I when I got there like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason because I was there in the moment I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else was doing so I wouldn't beat him I wouldn't be ostracized\nT:\tyeah I get it like we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once - you know I drank - I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules\nC:\tum I know that it's bad for me it's bad for my body it's bad for for for for being on the team for being an athlete it hinders my performance just I don't know I feel like my friends pressure me I don't know if I should like go with different fine groups maybe I don't know\nT:\tyeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure\nC:\tI don't know like being in a sports team you feel very you have to like be unified with the group\nT:\tyeah well you're one of the leaders\nC:\tright and as being one of the leaders but my fellow teammates expect me to be excited expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments and if that's social a social social custom in our society so\nT:\tmaybe Panther leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being I mean stake up my butt you know\nC:\tyou're a star player who's gonna pick on you\nT:\tI mean it's just one I'm just one person it's the\nC:\tall right well this is the mouth\nT:\tyeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook you know there there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun you're teenagers I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this\nC:\twell I'll dedicate the time not to party and like no not-not-not party but you get involved with alcohol to that extent and like have it publicized on the Internet\nT:\twhat do you mean\nC:\tlike on Facebook all the pictures that you saw him internet like I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see even though\nT:\tall right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay\nC:\tright oh stop\nT:\tall right you promise all right shake all right we'll see you later\n",
  "T:\tcome in\nC:\thello how are you today\nT:\tI'm very well thank you I just need money repeat prescription and whatsapp for the road doctor\nC:\tyou're ductile\nT:\tand that's\nC:\tall right know what when was the last time you got that prescription from us yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP hmm you shouldn't have been given the doctor why do you think you need that no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that trap anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose weight and what what are you doing about your lifestyle what are you doing about losing weight other than depending on tablets really that's doing a bit more stairs well it's gonna take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre-planning your meals and turning to healthy options because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water yeah but I roll the other doctors over wait you know so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a rap and just have it you know you could make her rap a healthy rap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because that'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so what I think he should maybe do is maybe just have a maybe do a diary of your lifestyle because well it's I know popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're gonna have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your might that you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that would make you feel more energized\nT:\tno lack of energy bear on your little day that's not a problem it's just really time to do something else it's just work asleep yeah\nC:\tso you need to put some thought into if you if that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself so are you putting on weight or have you been loosing the weight\nT:\tlet's think you can be steady\nC:\tso you've not you've not been losing weight with it\nT:\tthat's been okay\nC:\tso you can't you know it's it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as is lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policies in was their eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know soups salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way it's the hard way but it's that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose you will start losing the weak because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet well why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got cake keep a diary for two weeks if you if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and we're you know before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe sit you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietician to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight okay thank you you you\n",
  "T:\tokay finish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news\nC:\tthat's great\nT:\thowever I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on\nC:\tI don't smoke cigarettes\nT:\tokay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it\nC:\twell the only thing I've never smoked cigarettes ever but when when I go out with my friends we like to go to you know we'd like to go out to lounges and and you know sometimes there are those those nice young men that gift you different sorts of things and we got some of those mini cigars that swisher Sweets they come on peach and and grape and and you know that's the only time that really you know I've ever really used anything that that's got to pack Oh in it\nT:\tokay so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that\nC:\tI'm really bad but they're just little mini little cute little girly cigars\nT:\tright there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes\nC:\tboy only if it were just to relax I mean it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day I mean I only do it when we go out\nT:\tuh-huh well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting\nC:\twell I didn't really know I'd started\nT:\twhat do you mean\nC:\tI didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars\nT:\tso you're going to quit then\nC:\toh maybe\nT:\twhat do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit\nC:\twell it's something that I'll have to think about\nT:\twhat's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in\nC:\twell it's just something that I do to relax and I don't with that often and so I probably could cut back\nT:\tokay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger\nC:\twell I don't believe that their cigars and what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right and it's something that I choose to do and so I will think about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real\nT:\tyou're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze hukkah any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die\nC:\twell it's something that I'll think about\nT:\twell I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change\n",
  "T:\tso Tommy I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know you're such a good kid like I don't know what you're doing drinking it's gonna ruin your life\nC:\tI mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I ate all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do it Kate on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes\nT:\tTommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you it just really really concerns me\nC:\tright I get what you're coming from but I I really did I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone I didn't want to be you know how do I put this like I wanted to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay so I didn't let myself drink too much\nT:\tthere's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you\nT:\tyeah I understand exactly what you're saying and\nC:\thow much are you drinking I don't think I'm drinking that much I mean it's it's mainly for social gatherings like it's nothing that I do like by myself or whatever it's just that either\nT:\tlike every weekend\nC:\tevery other weekend I would say\nT:\tTommy I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do\nC:\tI guess I can I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from and is\nT:\tare your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with\nC:\tyeah I guess I haven't really put it on myself I guess it's really been forced on their account and I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun and I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can\nT:\twell there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here\nC:\tyeah I I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I it does make a lot of sense and I I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level drinking\nT:\tI think you really need to quit\nC:\tyeah I mean alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life\nT:\tI think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important\nC:\tyeah I I just I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but um\nC:\tdo you want to wait for that to happen do you want to wait for a dramatic experience\nT:\tyeah you're right I don't want I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape and I I guess I've never really had any any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much so I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of but in reality I might not have as much control as I think\nC:\tall right well maybe it's something we can work on together and you know I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking\nT:\tyeah I think that that would be a good step forward into an a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol\nC:\tokay sounds good\n",
  "C:\tand his wife has told him that if he doesn't quit drinking she's gonna leave and so he's totally the expert helping with this issue and so\nT:\tsupposedly is exactly the word supposedly is the

Dennis\nT:\tDennis okay alright and just so just substance abuse treatment counseling who knows exactly why he's here so\nC:\tyeah alright\nT:\tso Dennis\nC:\they hey good good\nT:\talright well um so I got a little bit of information as to why you're here but but maybe you can go ahead and just tell me\nC:\tyeah well my wife basically just said if I don't get um final stop drinking then she's leaving\nT:\tWow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it\nC:\tyeah yeah she said you know she's told me for a long time that she doesn't like it and our kids have said they don't like it she's never she's kind of threatened it but I think she needs it this time I don't\nT:\tokay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty\nC:\tyeah she just wants me to stop pretty\nT:\tout of about it okay so what do you think\nC:\twell I'm thinking that I've worked hard my whole life and I should be able to to drink if I want but you know I don't you know I never been arrested you know I've got I've done really good with the money that we have you know we live a pretty good life she gets to do what you wanted I get to do what I want and this is just something that I want to do so you know I and it's been that that you know I've been drinking since I think we met\nT:\tyeah\nC:\twe can vary it a long time\nT:\toh\nC:\tso I don't know what I I'm kind of like I know what the big deal is really and\nT:\tall right\nC:\tI don't want to quit\nT:\twhat's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up\nC:\tyeah I don't like it people tell me what to do\nT:\tyeah no no\nC:\tusually I just usually if someone tells me what to do like tell him to back off\nT:\twouldn't what to do\nC:\tand so but she's serious it's time so I don't know what to do so\nT:\tall right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hands you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned\nC:\twell she says she's worried about my health you know cuz I have high blood pressure you know worried about because my dad died of a heart attack at a really early age so she's afraid I'm just gonna I'm just gonna drop dead you know I outlive my dad by so many years and I you know and again it's my life\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso\nT:\tyeah yeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want\nC:\tright\nT:\tyou know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that but but you know everybody's got their choices to make in this situation okay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and that's but\nC:\tI was really little\nT:\tokay\nC:\twhen when he died\nT:\tso I don't know so you're not sure if that\nC:\twe died of heart attack\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyou know\nT:\tso you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not\nC:\tI probably did probably crank song but\nT:\tso you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking\nC:\tyeah the doctors have said I should quit drinking the doc or they know\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyou're not convinced but with the doc don't exactly that 20 years ago I need to quit drinking and\nT:\tokay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking 20 years ago and here you are it's still alive then\nC:\tI pretty much do whatever I want when I\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou know\nT:\tsurely\nC:\tno life because the way it's been I've given everybody wrong\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tof everybody\nT:\tokay\nC:\tso else you can say the live\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyou can say that\nT:\tokay max\nC:\tI'll work my way up I'm working my way up and once really high up my confident for a retiree\nT:\tokay huh\nC:\tyou've always thought I would do it\nT:\tso it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life\nC:\tis right\nT:\tit seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so um and\nC:\tshe doesn't get she doesn't she wasn't I don't think she recognized how hard I worked for it to have what we have\nT:\tokay\nC:\tyou know and I wish she just let me live the life I've always wanted to live you know and then part of its drinking I like drinking so\nT:\tokay okay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guide it sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like\nC:\tyeah is it\nT:\tit's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth\nC:\twell I would yeah because it might kill other people but I'm not going to let kill me\nT:\tokay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now\nC:\tif I if I tell you what I'm really thinking are you tell my wife but\nT:\tno no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking\nC:\tI do not assess us but you know I think you you I think you kind of get me kind understanding so I really you know my um my son's in AAA\nT:\tokay\nC:\tand and you know when he went into his treat treatment and he really was hard on me like he said that he blamed me for him you know get you know going down that path and and and I really felt like maybe I could have done more he and i were really close now we're not as close because he I can tell you this doesn't like to be around me as I drink and my daughter is she sent me a letter a while ago saying that she loved me and that she didn't want me to die and wanted my kids to be around her but her kids to be around me but she um she didn't want him around as much because cuz she didn't like it when I'm drinking so well so yeah I've had I've had those couple things that that maybe go maybe maybe that maybe I need to rethink this yeah and then I'm always one way and that's really like I still want to lose her I just don't\nT:\twell you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that\nC:\tthank thanks for talking again together I'll be hopping your straight shooter or I really appreciate that\nT:\talright okay thank you very much\nC:\tthanks\n",
  "T:\thi Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you\nC:\talright\nT:\tokay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself\nC:\tokay um my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school\nT:\tokay and what do you like to do for fun\nC:\tmostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends things like that\nT:\tand when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to ball games go to party\nC:\tif it's school related maybe like a game or two or go to the mall like to shop or go to the movies or something and that night maybe like a party or something someone's throwing\nT:\tokay and what kind of hobbies do you have\nC:\tum I like to be and I like to go outside and like take walks and like hike and stuff I'm very outdoorsy so oh cool\nT:\twhat are your plans for after high school\nC:\twell I plan to apply to college and maybe you know have a good career and something like that hopefully\nT:\tthat's great what do you think you'll study\nC:\twell I'm I'm looking at the journalism maybe pre-law\nT:\tOh neat\nC:\twhich is a little different but\nT:\tyeah that's great that's a really good goal\nC:\tyeah thanks\nT:\tit's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get\nC:\tI'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's so we're pretty good okay\nT:\tokay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in\nC:\tum I think all my grades raisin B's\nT:\toh\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay and do you know where you're going to apply to college\nC:\tI'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something\nT:\tokay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism\nC:\tum well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so\nT:\tokay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol\nC:\tum not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most\nT:\tokay and how often do you think you drink\nC:\tum maybe like once or twice a month at the most\nT:\tmm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year\nC:\tpossibly yeah\nT:\tso that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then\nC:\tyeah I guess you can say that\nT:\tokay what do you thinks the most you've ever had\nC:\tum just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all so\nT:\tbut you've been drunk before\nC:\tum no not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk\nT:\tokay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol\nC:\tum yeah yeah\nT:\tokay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done\nC:\tnever drunk driven and I've never got in the car with a drunk driver\nT:\tokay how much do your friends drink\nC:\tum I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that\nT:\tokay\nC:\tdrink a lot more\nT:\twhat about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot\nC:\tyeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you\nT:\tand do you hang out with them\nC:\tnot really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine\nT:\tmm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that\nC:\tum yeah that make sense\nT:\tyeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tyou know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that\nC:\tyeah yeah I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much so\nT:\tand then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that\nC:\tyeah definitely\nT:\tbut you're still drinking\nC:\tyeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so\nT:\tso I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney\nC:\tum definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of\nT:\tokay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer\nC:\tokay\nT:\tum obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that\nC:\tI definitely agree I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned like health-wise and things like that so I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing\nT:\tso do you think you can quit\nC:\tum yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life so\nT:\tokay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then\nC:\tyeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink\nT:\tokay and then what about your friends who are still drinking\nC:\tum I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will\nT:\tokay and what if they won't\nC:\twell then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything\nT:\tyeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence\nC:\tokay yeah\nT:\tand then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol\nC:\tokay yeah definitely\nT:\tokay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking\nC:\tthey would be pretty upset yeah they don't really condone alcohol use oh\nT:\tokay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here\nC:\tno I think I'm good\nT:\tokay um any questions or\nC:\tno no\nT:\tokay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in\nC:\tokay thanks\n",

  "T:\tgood morning is really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking what have you got in mind what you want from us\nC:\twell I need some medication if you can offer me some\nT:\tabsolutely when the right place for that\nC:\tand whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free\nT:\tokay what just remind me in why is you want to stop\nC:\tit's just these days I'm finding that I'm smoking 20 30 a day of getting sick of it in certain I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking\nT:\tgood and severe depression here\nC:\tespecially the other night I was at the restaurant it's been embarrassing on the only walk walking out\nT:\tso that can't feel like I'm comfortable being myself so that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's all getting smelly and it's getting see any other reasons um\nC:\tit's expensive these days it's actually cause to believe this about our buyer go through pack a day so it's almost seven pounds\nT:\tseven pounds a week or\nC:\tseven pounds a day today\nT:\tforty\nC:\tfifty\nT:\tcould really quit we even my math you see okay so we're talking about spec fifty couldn't we being one of the few left smoggy in your crowd and not liking the smell that sounds like three reasons do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes eight okay so have you got a date in mind when you like to stop smoking\nC:\twhat you do what do you suggest\nT:\tgenerally it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains one of the main reasons why you actually smoke what you enjoy most about\nC:\tit's just something when I bought it oh my god I smoke or something I go out as I said I'm the only one kind of outside thank you\nT:\tdo you think you'll be supposed about the\nT:\tsort of stresses\nC:\tjust when I go down after a break at work I go down I just need break away from it all just a shelf so I really enjoyed that the cigarette just helps me calm down\nT:\tdoes your favorite cigarette the day\nC:\tit's definitely the one at the end of evening\nT:\tat the end of the day I think that helps you just online put an end to the work section and move into your own time\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so after you've had the quit date what do you think you might do when is the first day at work it's time if you're not gonna cigarette\nC:\tI guess I'll just I'll just have some fresh air as well but this time without a cigarette in my hand to try and give myself regular breaks one of those tough things\nT:\thow do you manage to stop sneaking in the past\nC:\tI've managed for a couple of weeks and\nT:\twhat got you back it was\nC:\tto be honest is stress an argument with my partner\nT:\tremember it says I make just how many I sort of took you back into right let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here you really want to sort of thinking with this we kind of the last guy in your group still smoking it costs a lot of money and you don't be like smell the main reason that you smoke is because at the end of the day gives you the kind of relaxation and there's quite a little stress is going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with what you like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible when do you think would be a good time for you to choose to being your quit date okay\nC:\tso the weekend I've got a party coming up so maybe Monday morning\nT:\tMonday morning after party really good day that's next week okay now one of the things that we do the pharmacy is recommended medication to help you know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely come along a lot of people make using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches gum you probably seen people using any of these products and other options are tablets which you can get from the GP local champion again so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings\nC:\tI'm thinking one of these patches\nT:\tokay so patches I think you've already seen them again I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like this course of medication lasts for ten to twelve weeks and we strongly recommend that we will stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success stopping smoking is not easy but it's and when the type of support we offer here in the pharmacy you absolutely make your chance of success for x greater than try on your own so that's why it's really good that you come to see me you said that you really want to do it and then next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party's opened up with you've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette so what I like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with often a person who smokes that's exactly what it feels like when they're craving for cigarette what does it feel like to you thing that you want one\nC:\tit's just like a irritable\nT:\tokay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back\nC:\tnice Frank\n",
  "T:\tI you know you don't have to sign up if you don't want to but you know I'm kind of here to like fix things for you and just make sure everything goes no real smoothly with the different issues that you've been having and just kind of oh you know kind of manage things and just take care of stuff so you know it's again if you want the service you can have it but it's kind of up to you but I am here if you want me to be and you know I'll couldn't kind of teach you about things you might not know about or tell you some things about your house and you know just Marlys make sure everything goes okay so you know you think that might be something you'd be interested in wanting to be a part of because I'd you know really like to help you\nC:\tokay well sure when you put it that way sure\nT:\tbecause it seems like I you know you've expressed some health issues lately and I know you've had a lot of problems with your weight so that's certainly something we can talk about and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you\nC:\tum I eat too much you eat too much yeah\nT:\tso why do you eat too much I mean how is that a problem\nC:\tbecause whenever I'm stressed out about anything it makes me feel relaxed and calm\nT:\tso you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat more than you know you should be eating\nC:\tyes like do you know about portion control has anyone told you about like you know a card size for a piece of meat or some salad I mean have you has anyone showed you that cuz I can pull out our\nT:\tyeah yeah\nC:\tsamples and give you those that I could probably tell you about it\nT:\tyou could tell me about it I mean about what you should be eating for yeah meat size and like you know baseball size for fruit so it's not that you don't know about it you you you do know about poor lighting control\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a means you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop\nC:\twell I guess you told me that you know a lot and you can fix my problem so that that's interesting I'm that's one of the reasons why I decided to participate so I was wondering if you could tell me\nT:\twell that's great I could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self-control I mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self-control and you know I found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not eat any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either I mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so\nC:\tit sounds though that you're seeing some opposite things because when one moment you're saying not have any don't have any junk but then allow yourself ice cream once in a while so that would make it really confusing for me\nT:\toh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure I have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then I can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising that's certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising\nC:\toh I haven't been exercising lately\nT:\toh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then you Muenster now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there and all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound\nC:\twell what does walking three times a week like for how long really like you know\nT:\tsure whatever whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success and doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at ten fifteen minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active\nC:\tokay\nT:\tand then I think the flute journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there and deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journal is going so\nC:\tthat seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things\nT:\tyeah if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call I'm always available so if there is something that you find that's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by all means just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know\nC:\tmy weights been coming up so I think things will come up in a month\nT:\tyeah well I I would hope that with some you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're gonna eat a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to a scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that help with having to write things down and I think we're just gonna take it step by step but again there's my phone and my extension so I'm here if you need me\nC:\tokay\nT:\tso let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tonya I'm really glad you were able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as I explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit I'm available for you as your own personal coach you know I am a nurse but I have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you there help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would express on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now\nC:\tokay well basically I feel like if I don't if I don't stay on certain habits and routines then everything just kind of goes kaput\nT:\tso the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your house\nC:\tyeah I realize there's certain things I have to do in order to stay on on track yeah or else everything just kind of then I start noticing that I get into this whole this whole myriad of unhealthy unhealthy things I feel yucky basically\nT:\tso it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that\nC:\thmm\nT:\tthey just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically\nC:\tyeah I don't start field of it in general physically and then I you know I I yeah I can feel a change in my body and I just feel yucky because I'm then I end up not doing anything really\nT:\toh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you started feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or\nC:\tyeah yeah it's kind of I move on and good habit reinforces on the so they build upon each other and it's sort of like if I don't have that collection of good habits then yeah I start to feel it because I'm not exercising and then I start to feel you know the fat come on and yeah\nT:\tfor you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost the quickl you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso it just kind of builds on itself\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of goals what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen\nC:\twell I think just doing those things that do make me feel good you know tell me a little bit about those drinking water eating a certain amount of fruits and vegetables per day giving a certain amount of activity in per day and I was just thinking lately what's important to me is having one kind of thing that I do around physical activity that's social so I'm around other people and I realized that that makes a big difference to\nT:\tOh social physical activity\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tthat you get to be out and be with people like\nC:\tyeah j\nT:\tust doing on your own right like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out we're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who they're their general goal is to you know do physical tivity and feel better through it\nC:\thmm so that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tthat's rather than just you're wrong\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tyeah I'm working toward this together as a group\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tso you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you're really trying to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten just just on importance\nT:\tyeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight\nC:\tWow eight\nT:\tyeah it's really really up there\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tit's not a four or five right why would you say an eight not a four or five\nC:\tbecause I that it's a it is important for me to have social interaction and be around people who are doing like I guess you'd say like-minded like-minded things and then it becomes less just about me and more about you know just sharing\nT:\toh okay it's about sharing there's that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tso if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks\nC:\toh\nT:\tyou could start one obviously you've got steps to find it\nC:\tright\nT:\tinvolved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity\nC:\ttwo weeks seems reasonable I think I can do it within two weeks so I would give that a eight\nT:\tso you would get that in ages yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tdefinitely more than a six or seven and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that\nC:\tyeah\nT:\twhat do you see as some of the barriers that might get in your way\nC:\tum I guess just structuring my time better\nT:\tstructuring your day better\nC:\tyes yes so really not slacking off and really not saying okay well I'm tired you know now tonight I'll just wait till tomorrow basically that\nT:\tso finding the time in your day\nC:\tyeah\nT:\table to do or not do this or not\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tand how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing or\nC:\tthe evening yeah yeah right now the way the way just my today is structured with what I need to do in terms of um work and other commitments\nT:\tokay\nC:\tevening yeah\nT:\tso one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you\nC:\tI think that would be that would be okay I could always have a cup of coffee beforehand\nT:\tyou can always have a cup of coffee\nC:\tyes yes\nT:\twell it would be okay with you I would to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you're\nC:\tright\nT:\tthe day but but that anymore water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and looking at trend\nC:\tright\nT:\tthen to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness\nC:\tright\nT:\tokay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks\nC:\tsure\nT:\tthat would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in\nC:\tokay thank you\n",
  "T:\tokay it's a good morning my name is Jane\nC:\tyeah I'm Michelle\nT:\tokay so I'll be regional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help you\nC:\tum well I mean I wasn't really expecting this it really caught me off guard and I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest you know but I didn't think things were this bad I mean my life is pretty hectic so I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself\nT:\tyeah so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing it might be quite scared too\nC:\tyeah I'm a little scared but more worried than anything I mean my career is really important to me and I don't really want my pre-diabetes to set me down and I don't really want to have to take medication I'm absolutely terrified of needles so I don't want to be picking myself all the time and then watching what I eat and counting carbohydrates and everything it just sounds like a whole lot of hassle that I don't have time for it you know\nT:\tyou feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hear you say is you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career\nC:\tmm-hmm basically I guess that's what there's so much of mark that I've kind of forgotten to take care of myself and I guess I'm really she did myself in the foot because that's what's cosmic pre-diabetes you know so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves\nT:\tmm-hmm yeah and I obviously haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so\nC:\tcan you tell me a little bit more about what you do well I'm an ESL teacher so I teach English to foreign students and adults I work in a community center close by but I also spend a lot of my days traveling it's just part of the job so I eat out often and always on ago and it makes following a healthy diet and lifestyle pretty difficult and I mean I know exercise and diet I guess that honestly could work out at the gym at the hotels but they aren't always available you know okay\nT:\tso you recognize the importance of exercise yeah I do but when I get that free time I just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too\nC:\tso yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life exercise is huge in managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels\nT:\tum well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication\nC:\tI think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise\nT:\tum I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise so it would be a big step a big change for me\nC:\tcan you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week I need you to do it more than just one day\nT:\tum I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym I'm just unsure as whether I can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy a gym membership here because I'm not at home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money\nC:\tand I really think that making exercise important part of your life is\nT:\tyeah I mean I just I don't know it's it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy its begin with so it would be a really big step\nC:\tI'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you his name is George this is this hot Italian guy he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him\nT:\tI mean maybe that I still don't know\nC:\tthis will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it'll lower your blood sugar body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better\nT:\tyeah I mean like I said we'll see\nC:\twell thanks for coming in today I feel very confident about this exercise thing that we'll be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day\nT:\tI'll see you next time\nC:\tokay\nT:\tbye thank you\nC:\tT\nT:\tso good morning my name is Jane yeah I'll be your nutritional therapist today so the doctor had told you recently that you have pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news just so that I can better help you\nC:\tum Wow I mean I wasn't really expecting any of this at all you need to kind of caught me off guard and I'm still kind of in shock I mean I know what I eat is only the healthiest but I mean my life is pretty hectic so I mean I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself I just didn't think it was that bad you know I had pre-diabetes or anything\nT:\tso see you were pretty shocked with this news and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too\nC:\tyeah I mean no worries me quite a bit my career is really important to me and I really don't want dive used to slow me down of course nobody wants to take medication and I am definitely afraid of needles so I mean I don't want to be picky myself all day and I'm an ESL teacher and basically I teach English to foreign students and adults and so I work at a community center close by but I also travel quite a bit which I mean I eat out often just because of that and I don't really get to exercise much because I mean a moment ago and some of these hotels don't really have any gyms or anything in the areas are places where you want to go and run and so I mean following a healthy diet is would be pretty hard and I mean I guess I could maybe work out that some of those gems but you know after a long day honestly all you really want to do is just veg out you know and not really have to go to the gym and you know sweat\nT:\tyeah so you feel like travel at first the affects your health but you recognize the importance of exercise and diet\nC:\tyeah I mean I know it's good for you but I absolutely hate exercising I mean I think it's so boring and I just I don't know it's not comfortable and I just I don't like making the time for it you know what my life is so busy it's just the last thing on my list so\nT:\tbut your lack of exercise is a concern to you it sounds like yeah a little bit I mean it does bother me like when I was younger I was much thinner and I exercise all the time not do all these sports and everything so I mean it definitely does concern me a little bit you know that I've gotten so far from that you know\nC:\tso you mentioned that your bother by the way that you look and you also mention that your diet is less than helpful\nT:\tyeah like I said I have to eat out often just because I travel a lot and also I am always on the go so I'd like driving somewhere like Panera I love Nara and I usually get like breakfast or lunch there sometimes both I think one of my favorite things is the super little bread bowl and I end up usually eating a majority of the bread ball which I know it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world and of course they give you those other options like the apples in the salad but I mean I like to stick with stuff that I like and I don't know like any of that and I mean I also don't eat too many sweets you know I mean so I think I'm okay you know sometimes I eat fine but when I travel I do like to try all the local restaurants and everything sometimes that is a bakery or - my absolute favorite thing in the world peanut butter and jelly donut I mean if you haven't tried them I'll bring one in for you to try because they're absolutely heaven and my dr. pepper honestly you can't live without my dr. pepper\nC:\talright\nT:\twhat keeps me going so okay\nC:\tso you mentioned there are healthier options available in restaurants that you go\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tand you said you don't eat sweets often but you also mention your dr. pepper and I can't help but recognize this huge\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tthat's on our desk\nT:\tyeah\nC:\tI mean CERN is what keeps me going throughout the day I mean obviously the caffeine and then a little bit of sugar kick that it gives me it really helps me get through those really long days you know and I mean I've been drinking these things since I was a teenager so I mean just just second nature it's just have it you know\nT:\tso soda is that energy boost to help you through the day\nC:\tmm-hmm and I mean I just stopped by the gas station on the way to work I mean like I don't know it's just stuff it make in the morning you know just have it like I stopping it guess I maybe make it another one you know that mean yeah it's just part of my life you know\nT:\tokay so we could go in a number of directions here and I wonder which makes the most sense to you um you mentioned exercise possibly getting some healthier options when you go out and you also mention your soda consumption you may also have other things that we haven't mentioned today that you would like to discuss further so which would you like to discuss\nC:\tum I mean I guess I should really cut down and soda I mean I know it has a lot of sugar in it and maybe that'll help with the pre-diabetes a little bit I just get so tired throughout the day and like the caffeine obviously and a little bit of sure kick really helps me keep going throughout the day you know so\nT:\tso it sounds like your soda intake uh something that you know is that a control and you must not feel that energized if you have to keep drinking it throughout the day\nC:\tyeah I mean I do normally feel really a sluggish and fatigue all day long you know so it could be part of it\nT:\tso your soda consumptions a habit you'd like to break\nC:\tyeah I mean really in lieu of the shocking news it might be time to change\nT:\tso would you like to hear some ways that my other patients kind of get an energy boost that are not soda\nC:\tyeah I'm gonna say I would love any suggestions I mean my taller tolerance for caffeine has just increased so much that like some nays let me drink to three of these and I know that's not really recommended so yeah I would like to hear some alternatives\nT:\tso my other diabetic patients that like caffeine and a little sweet they will either have one cup of coffee in the morning or they'll drink unsweetened tea and if you like something we don't really condone artificial sweeteners but you could add a packet of stevia Splenda to your tea that's not a problem so how does that sound\nC:\tum I mean I sound I think that sounds okay um I do you like sweet tea or sweetie sometimes unsweet tea so I think I'll be okay with making that switch to like an unsweetened stevia or something so I mean I could definitely make some switches you know\nT:\tso you sound ready to make a change you sound ready to go um do you perceive any obstacles or challenges that you might foresee with changing your soda intake\nC:\tmm-hmm I definitely think I will crave the sugar I'm really afraid I won't make it throughout the day without caffeine you know so that I mean those are definitely things that I see as barriers you know to me making these changes you know\nT:\tso that's definitely a legitimate worry I think the smart thing to do is to gradually wean you off sooner um I think you might be feeling a little lethargic and fatigued just because you're dehydrated so maybe swapping out some of the soda for water tea somedays will definitely help you out\nC:\tum I mean that it sound it definitely sounds fine I think I can definitely swap out some of the soda with tea or coffee I mean that'll help me with the caffeine withdrawal you know and maybe I could even increase my water intake I know I heard it also helps with fatigue you know so I mean it's definitely doable and I'm living it something I could do\nT:\tgreat and next time we can even talk about your diet because I know fruit and vegetable intake can also give you a natural energy boost so\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay so those ideas sound really great in our sessions coming to a close I just wanted to thank you for being so open today and next time you come in we can talk about your diet and your soda consumption if you ever have any questions we're right here just give us a call but again thanks for coming in\nC:\tyeah sure I'll see you next time\n",
  "﻿T:\tI don't know how much you've been told about why you're here but basically it's my job just to meet with all the students I usually meet with you once or twice a semester and gonna be talking to kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that. Okay so why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself\nC:\tWell my name's Andrea as you know I'm in the marching band I played a tenor sax and involved in music so I'm also in the Jazz Band the Wind Ensemble and yeah  that's about okay I'm an IB student \nT:\tokay, how long ago did you start playing saxophone\nC:\tWell saxophone I started about four years ago but I've been involved in music for about ten years now \nT:\tWow that's a long time what other instruments? \nC:\tI started off on the violin first okay that for like six years once the clarinet double here and there with different things and then I found the one the one per week back \nT:\tawesome, and you played tenor sax? \nC:\tyeah that's an aside \nT:\tWow, and how long have you been in marching? \nC:\tband marching band since freshman year... just a couple years\nT:\tokay great and how do you like marching band?\nC:\tit's fun it's a lot of work long summers taught but it's fun \nT:\twhat are your favorite parts about it?\nC:\tI really like the group setting oh we're getting to work with my other classmates and things like that and putting on this entire show it's very exciting very exhilarating once you're in competition \nT:\tokay cool cool and you have a lot of friends who are in band with you? \nC:\tyeah friends outside of Bandar I have them you know to to supper group to have my friends from class and then my friends from Brand from band \nT:\tokay great and then tell me a little bit about your family?\nC:\twell I'll have one brother he's older than me about nine years older than me and my parents and my dog \nT:\tokay what kind of dog do you have? \nC:\tgolden retriever \nT:\toh nice\nC:\tCharlie \nT:\tCharlie \nC:\tYeah \nT:\thave you had him a long time?\nC:\tyeah he's about eight years old now \nT:\toh gosh okay very cool. and what are your plans for after high school?\nC:\tuh well I'm planning on going to school I'd like to become a doctor one day\nT:\tWow \nC:\tI'm interested in psychology psychiatry something like that \nT:\tyou've got big dreams. \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tAlright have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology\nC:\tI haven't really thought too much about which school I mean I everyoen wants to shoot for the Ivy League\nT:\talright and how about your grades?\nC:\tthey're pretty good you know high three point something \nT:\tokay good very good. Alright well what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?\nC:\toh I usually go out with my friends. we'll go to the movies or will most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house and just hang out of things \nT:\tmhm...when you're hanging out is there ever alcohol sometimes? \nC:\tI'm gonna be Audie sometimes \nT:\tso how often do you think you drink alcohol?\nC:\tum um...depending on how much schoolwork there is when there's not it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month \nT:\toh so you're drinking a lot. oh yeah okay and how much are you drinking on the days that you're... on the days that you drink?\nC:\tum I don't we don't get blackout drunk or anything it's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing I have gotten blackout drunk before but I kind of did that learned my lesson nothing like it\nT:\tgot it. so you've you've had some pretty heavy drinking. what do you thinks the most you've ever had? like how many drinks?\nC:\tyeah um it was a good amount it was the first time I ever drank and it was three or four cups but it was mixing different things \nT:\tokay so you don't even know. okay so and then your friends drink too?  \nC:\tyeah yes not all of them.. some of them \nT:\tokay, and how much do they typically drink?\nC:\tmore or less the same amount so right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup I don't do that one time but sometimes one or two but they can be kind of heavy \nT:\tokay so it's one cup but let's imagine not what I drink a lot of alcohol in it okay. so gosh you're you're actually really drinking quite a lot you know your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group so is that surprising to you?\nC:\ta little bit yeah \nT:\tso we caught high risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that so you know things like having car accidents or other accidents or getting in fights or you know sexual assault or health problems or developing alcoholism have you thought about those things?\nC:\tnot too much to be honest I've always thought since it's you know within my small group of friends and we usually sleep over each other the house we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving and possibly sexual assaults and things like that but I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything \nT:\tOkay, so it's good because you are not drinking and driving but you're still really drinking a lot and yeah okay so let's let's talk a little bit about that how you might be able to make some changes cuz I think you really need to need to stop drinking like this \nC:\tokay \nT:\tso do you think you could quit drinking? or.. \nC:\tyeah I think I could I don't need it for instance it it is used as a kind of like let's get the party going uh-huh we haven't always had it obviously so I think it would be possible to stop drinking \nT:\tokay so does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?\nC:\tum I would probably start off by like because my friends are also involved so I feel like hey guys I don't think I'm gonna drink today and kind of see how that goes \nT:\tokay cuz you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work \nC:\tyeah it's you know it's one thing to control my own drinking and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure T\tmm-hmm \nC:\tI was thinking I think I look stupid okay\nT:\tso how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid.. \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tokay so I mean do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?\nC:\tmy close ones I know they wouldn't be you know have a problem with that but the ones that I'm not that close to its but I'll still like hang out with those are probably the ones that I think made ostracize nice or something \nT:\tit sounds like you might be better off without them though there yeah maybe not very good friends probably \nC:\tmight be too judgmental mm-hmm \nT:\tso so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stopdrinking and I think you should probably stop as soon as possible like this weekend okay so the way this normally works is you know we set your goal and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually stopped and so what do you think about?\nC:\tthat I think I think the possibility okay so make a good plan like I think I'd be able to follow \nT:\tokay great so the plan is going to be that you're gonna quit and the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive you're just gonna not hang out with anymore yeah okay and then um you know like are your friends in band drinking?\nC:\tum not not really the ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends okay my friends we're focused on bands uh-huh can't relieve \nT:\tokay so that might be good is really just to focus more on band um cuz you know the other big concern I have for you is if you want to go to medical school you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this yeah you know like college is gonna be really hard and especially without those pre-med classes you're not gonna be able handle it. Drinking this much you know have you thought about that?\nC:\tnot too much to be honest yeah \nT:\tokay so setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you and it sounds like it shouldn't be that tough really especially because you can just stop hanging out with the people who drink a lot since you have some other friends yeah so do you have any questions for me?or...\nC:\twhat should I write yeah I do so what should I say like once let's say I hang out with my friends and I like they why aren't you why aren't you drinking \nT:\tmm-hmm \nC:\tlike how should I go about that situation \nT:\twell you know one good option would be to just review with them all the bad things about alcohol you can say you know I thought about it and I realized it's gonna mess up my homework and you know it's really a lot of risk for my health I don't want to become an alcoholic you know I don't want to get liver disease I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents or getting in fights you know one thing you could bring up is I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid and then people post stuff on Instagram and you know that's it for their social life it's like over\nC:\tso and and you know like professional life as well I don't want that biting me yeah but \nT:\tI think just tell your friends you know you realize there's all these bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore so you're just not going to okay and then you can tell them to stop - you know then that'd be really good good news\nC:\tyou know as a group we but we all work together to become better yeah\nT:\tyeah exactly all right any other questions or anything else I can help with?\nC:\tno I think I think I'm good okay so\nT:\tlike I said I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually quit drinking okay all\nC:\tright sounds good\nT:\tgreat   ",
  "﻿T:\tgood morning mrs. Smith just need to get your blood pressure can you roll your sleeve up for me how are you doing today?\nC:\toh pretty good always busy this time of year but keeping up. How are you doing?\nT:\tgreat... all right your blood pressure's  over \nC:\tthat's good right?\nT:\tyes \nC:\tgood I've always been really healthy \nT:\twell not always it looks like you got a letter about your ac and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes\nC:\tmy what?\nT:\tyour ac it measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months to determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar \nC:\toh yeah I got that letter but I didn't really know what it meant and I never really pay attention to my diabetes because I feel fine. How bad is it?\nT:\tit well let's see today it was eight point seven and three months ago it was . so normal is less than six your way out of control \nC:\twell like I said I've been really busy this month \nT:\twell your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?\nC:\tnot really I'd rather use diet and exercise \nT:\twell it looks like that's not really adequate so you need to be taking your medication. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough your chart says that you've been prescribed metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think would be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?\nC:\tum yeah sometimes \nT:\tokay how often?\nC:\tOh once every few weeks but I feel fine so I don't think it's that bad\nT:\twe'll remember your ac was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel so um it showed that you were out of control if you don't start making changes you could permanently damage your eyesight blood vessels even have to have a foot or leg amputated \nC:\toh well I would definitely do something before it got that bad but I'm not interested in taking those medications I'll try to eat better or something \nT:\tI don't think you realize how serious your diseases \nC:\tI don't see how I can be so sick if I feel fine I don't want to take medications\nT:\tjust because you feel fine doesn't mean you're healthy having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big  old sore on their foot \nC:\twell I remember my doctor telling me something about the symptoms of high blood sugar like feeling shaky or tired but I never feel shaky and tired \nT:\twell those are symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms that's the whole reason for doing an ac to determine if your blood Sugar's been out of control and your ac showed your blood sugar has them out of control \nC:\tI get what you're saying but I feel fine  and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel and better I mean what if it makes me worse when my grandfather was on heart medications the levels got so high that he almost had a heart attack \nT:\theart medications and diabetic medications are very different you can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication they're completely different. Will we at least try again taking your medications? \nC:\tI don't know I'll think about it alright \nT:\twell we'll see you in a few months then  ",

Before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please..okay thanks..yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking \nC:\tokay I I'm really confused I he did want me to come and talk to you I'm just not real thrilled with the way this is going well \nT:\tI'm sure you're not because anybody that the drinks of these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself what we know is that if you if you continue to drink at this rate you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more and imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now..\nC:\tI think I was drinking that much I mean a you know one or two glasses of happy \nT:\tthis is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so what I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than that. What would you say?\nC:\tyou don't... you are not in my household you don't know what idea it is about that size maybe maybe a little more\nT:\tI don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication at that point. I can't promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking. So any questions for me? \nC:\tand no no questions at all all right\nT:\twell thanks and I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through \nC:\tyou tell me wherever you want\nT:\tall right thanks  ",

Okay, there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it. Okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time okay all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay okay \nC:\tokay\nT:\twhat questions do you have any questions at all?\nC:\tno should be good okay \nT:\twell if that's it I guess you can go ahead now so here's your prescription\nC:\tthank you \nT:\tall right have a nice day  \n",
  "﻿T:\tLaura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you. alright okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself? \nC:\tokay um my name is Laura and I'm  and I'm a senior in high school\nT:\tokay, and what do you like to do for fun?\nC:\tmostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends things like that\nT:\tand when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to?\nC:\tball games go to party if it's school related maybe like a game or two or go to the mall like to shop or go to the movies or something and that night maybe like a party or something someone's throwing \nT:\tokay and what kind of hobbies do you have?\nC:\tum I like to be and I like to go outside and like take walks and like hike and stuff I'm very outdoorsy\nT:\tso oh cool what are your plans for after high school?\nC:\twell I plan to apply to college and maybe you know have a good career and something like that hopefully\nT:\tthat's great what do you think you'll study?\nC:\twell I'm I'm looking at the journalism maybe pre-law \nT:\tOh neat \nC:\twhich is a little different but yeah \nT:\tthat's great that's a really good goal yeah\nC:\tthanks \nT:\tit's a hard work to get into law school. How are you doing in  school? what kind of grades do you get?\nC:\tI'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's \nT:\tso we're pretty good okay okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?\nC:\tum I think all my grades raisin B's \nT:\toh yeah okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college? \nC:\tI'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something \nT:\tokay cool, and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism?\nC:\tum well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so \nT:\tokay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?\nC:\tum not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most \nT:\tokay and how often do you think you drink?\nC:\tum maybe like once or twice a month at the most \nT:\tmm-hmm so like once or wice a month you're having alcohol?\nC:\tyeah\nT:\tokay and so that's maybe like  times a year possibly yeah so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then \nC:\tyeah I guess you can say that \nT:\tokay what do you think the most you've ever had?\nC:\tum just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all \nT:\tso but you've been drunk before? \nC:\tno not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk \nT:\tokay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day. okay interesting. so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?\nC:\tum yeah \nT:\tyeah okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing. all right, have you ever done that have you ever done ever drunk driven? \nC:\tand I've never got in the car with a drunk driver \nT:\tokay, how much do your friends drink?\nC:\tum I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that okay drink a lot more \nT:\twhat about at these parties you're going to? there are other kids there who are drinking a lot?\nC:\tyeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you \nT:\tand do you hang out with them?\nC:\tnot really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine\nT:\tmm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?\nC:\tum yeah \nT:\tthat make sense. yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about?\nC:\tthat yeah, I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much\nT:\tso and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that? \nC:\tyeah definitely \nT:\tbut you're still drinking\nC:\tyeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so \nT:\tso I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney?\nC:\tum definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of \nT:\tokay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer \nC:\tokay \nT:\tum obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that?\nC:\tI definitely agree I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned like health-wise and things like that so I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing\nT:\tso do you think you can quit?\nC:\tum yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life \nT:\tso okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decisio um so I guess can you quit this weekend?\nC:\tyeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink \nT:\tokay and then what about your friends who are still drinking?\nC:\tum I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will \nT:\tokay and what if they won't?\nC:\twell then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything \nT:\tyeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should ust find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol\nC:\tokay yeah definitely \nT:\tokay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking they would be pretty upset \nC:\tyeah they don't really condone alcohol use \nT:\toh okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then \nC:\tum okay\nT:\tyeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here no I think I'm good okay um any questions or no?\nC:\tno \nT:\tokay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in   ",

I mean about what you should be eating for ya meet size and like you know baseball size for food so it's not that you don't know about you you you do know about poor iron control yeah so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a let me know if you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop?\nC:\twell I guess you told me that you know a lot and you can fix my problem so that that's interesting i'm that's one of the reasons why i decided to participate so i was wondering if you could tell me \nT:\twell that's great i could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self control i mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self control and you know i found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not need any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either i mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so \nC:\tit sounds though that you're seeing some opposite things because when one moment you're saying not have any don't have any junk but then allow yourself ice cream once in a while so that would make it really confusing for me \nT:\toh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure i have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then i can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising it certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising?\nC:\toh I haven't been exercising lately \nT:\toh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then months from now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound?\nC:\twell what does walking three times a week like for how long really like you know \nT:\tsure what it was or whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success in doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at - minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active okay and then I think the food journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there I'm deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it \nC:\tokay \nT:\tso how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journals going? C\twell that seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things come on it yeah \nT:\tif you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call i'm always available so if there is something that you find it's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by Allah me just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know my weights been coming up so \nC:\tI think things will come up in a month yeah\nT:\twell I I would hope that with some little you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're going to eat them a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that helps with having to write things down and I think we're just going to take it step by step but again there's my I'm phoning my extension so I'm here if you need me okay so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tanya I'm really glad you're able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as i explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit i'm available for you as your own personal coach you know i am a nurse but i have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you to help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would expressed on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now C\tokay well basically I feel like if I don't if I don't stay on certain habits and routines then everything just kind of goes kaput \nT:\tso the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your health?\nC:\tyeah I realize there's certain things i have to do in order to stay on on track yeah or else everything just kind of then i start noticing that i get into this whole this whole myriad of unhealthy unhealthy things and I feel yucky basically \nT:\tso it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that hmm they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically?\nC:\tyeah I don't start feel good in general physically and then I you know I I yeah I can feel a change in my body and I just feel yucky because I'm then I end up not doing anything really \nT:\toh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you start feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or \nC:\tyeah yeah it's kind of a move one and good habit reinforces on the other so they build upon each other and it's sort of like if I don't have that collection of good habits then yeah I start to feel it because I'm not exercising and then I start to feel you know the fat come on and yeah \nT:\tfor you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost cyclical and the fact if you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight yeah so it just kind of builds on itself \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tso what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of gold what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen?\nC:\twell I think just doing those things that do make me feel good you know \nT:\ttell me a little bit about those \nC:\tdrinking water eating a certain amount of fruits and vegetables per day getting a certain amount of activity in per day and I was just thinking lately what's important to me is having one kind of thing that I do around physical activity that's social so I'm around other people and I realized that that makes a big difference to \nT:\ta social physical activity yeah that you get to be out and be with people like yeah just doing on your own\nC:\tright like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out we're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who their their general goal is to you know do physical tivity and feel better through it\nT:\tso that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together yeah that's rather than just your own yeah we aren't working toward this together as a group yeah so you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you really need to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten? just just on importance \nC:\tyeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight T\tWow on eight yeah no it's really really up there yeah it's not a four-fight right and why would you say it aint not a four or five?\nC:\tbecause I real i SAT tom it's a it is important for me to have a social interaction and be around people who are doing like I guess you could say like-minded like-minded things and then it becomes less just about me and more about you know just sharing \nT:\tokay it's about sharing is that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you yeah so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks? oh that you could start one obviously that steps to find it I involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity \nC:\ttwo weeks seems reasonable I think I can do it within two weeks so I would give that a  \nT:\tso you would get that in aid as yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you yeah I'm definitely more than a  and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that yeah what do you see is some of the barriers that might get in your way? \nC\tum I guess just um structuring my time better Chuck sure you're doing better yes yes so really not slacking off and really not saying okay well I'm tired you know now tonight I'll just wait till tomorrow basically that \nT:\tso finding the time in your day be able to do or not do this or not yeah and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing around the evening? \nC:\tYeah Yeah right now the way the way--just might today is structured with what I need to do in terms of them work and other commitments okay evening yeah \nT:\tso one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you? \nC:\tI think that would be that would be okay I could always have a cup of coffee beforehand you can always have a cup of coffee at we're hand yes \nT:\twell if it be okay with you I would love to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you are hailed the day but but that any more water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and look at my friend right then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness right okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks sure that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in okay thank you  \n",

  "﻿T:\texam looked just fine so the only thing I'm still kind of worried about is the stomach problems and we'll keep our eye on those the labs that we drew today will get those results back to you as soon as they're available all right good now before you Dooley today i noticed that you did fill out our alcohol questionnaire is that okay with you if I look over that?\nC:\tsure well \nT:\tthank you so just briefly looking over this let me first verify what you're drinking? and how often? that sort of thing so we're on the same page what is it that you typically drink?\nC:\tjust beer just beer no just regular beer \nT:\tso I have a picture here this shows what a standard  ounce beer looks like is that what she'd say you're drinking typically? okay so  ounce beers how many days a week are you drinking?\nC:\tum most weekend I guess about three days a week on average \nT:\tokay about three days a week and on each of those days how many beers are you drinking in a typical day?\nC:\tfour or five sometimes a six-pack all right no more than that \nT:\tso up to a six pack three days a week all right so based on that information that you've given me and then also looking at your questionnaire here I have some information that i can give you as just a way of giving you some feedback about your drinking is that okay sure with you okay well your score on this was  so if you look right here on my card a score of  places you in the high-risk room category yes sir so this means you are at higher risk for problems developing as a result of your drinking that could be accidents or Falls or even health problems like damage to your digestive system that sort of thing what do you think about that?\nC:\twell I sure wasn't aware that I like drinking with my friends and relaxing on the weekends at home watching TV some of my friends really do have drinking but I don't drink like that \nT:\tso for you this information is not only knew but it's really surprising yeah too and it could be that drinking at the level that you're drinking could be directly related to the stomach problems that you're talking about today what do you make about that information?\nC:\twell I don't know what to make of it it's surprising it's news to me \nT:\tI hear that I can understand that and like you said for you drinking with your friends is enjoyable and on the weekends at home helps you relax I'm curious what on the other hand would be some of the not so good things about drinking alcohol for you?\nC:\twell okay thank you vineyard it hasn't caused any adverse effects that I'm aware of I'd never connect the stomach issue with drinking \nT:\tso you see really no need to change your drinking? C\tno not really \nT:\tokay well for a man your age in this high risk category it is recommended that you actually cut out drinking altogether to reduce that risk what do you think about that?\nC:\twell I'm not sure what to think about it I never considered not drinking I'd never thought that that what to me seems like a small insignificant amount of drinking is I never thought of that as being a problem \nT:\twell it would definitely be my recommendation if you could even cut back you know half of what you're drinking then you'd cut that risk in half and again it's recommended that you quit all together and I would definitely suggest you work on that \nC:\twell I'll certainly think about it and I appreciate the information okay well \nT:\tthanks for listening thanks for discussing this with me \nC:\tsure thank you  \n",

  "﻿T:\tcome in hey doctor hello how are you today?\nC:\tI'm very well thank you have you seen many repeat prescription and what's up for the real doctor Reducto and that's for my my class cuz I've done with it all of them \nT:\tright no no no no what when was the last time you got that prescription from us?\nC:\talthough you few miles back \nT:\tyes I'm surprised did you see the local GP?\nC:\tyeah could be hmm \nT:\tyou shouldn't have been given a doctor why do you think you need that?\nC:\tI'm using it for a while this kind of referee well because i've been using rate and it well a little bit wait but it helps i'm not so happy anymore and I kind of think it's a bit more and still lose weight\nT:\tno no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that drug anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose sweet and what what are you doing about your lifestyle? what are you doing about losing weight? other than depending on tablets?\nC:\toh okay and change my cooter died kick both ways however Larry's I kind of working chichester really that's doing a bit more stairs and but doesn't much time for you \nT:\twell it's going to take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance? if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre planning your meals and turning to healthy options? because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water \nC:\toh yeah we don't get meals we can't have to do it in between and Julie doctor at the hospital we have a good time and we need to kind of just bringing her face yeah lovely often you can to be kind you can't even get food is just like you chocolate or something \nT:\tyeah but I roll the other doctors overweight no no so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a wrap and just have it you know you could make a wrap a healthy wrap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because i'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so and what I think you should maybe do as maybe just have a maybe do a diet e of your lifestyle because well it's a no popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're going to have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your magnet you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you're there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer C\tI'll just get one half down to the last few months of my job and then \nT:\tno I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that you feel more energized \nC:\toh I've not lack of energy around all day that's not a problem it's just really time I'm getting time to do something else moment it's just work asleep I'm afraid mm-hmm not much to be there it's just wreck yeah \nT:\tso you need to put some thought into if you is that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself \nC:\tI think I'll be able to do as I finish this job but I just need something now mm-hmm because otherwise I can't really afford to buy new clothes and it was it was keeping me kid \nT:\tso are you putting on weight or have you been losing the weight?\nC:\tlet's think you can be steady and speak \nT:\tso you've not you've not been losing weight with it? C \tthat's being okay yeah I probably should put on weight of an that's been using it yeah\nT:\tso you can't you know it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as its lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policy Asian was there eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know I'm soup salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way is the hard way but it's the only way yeah \nC:\tI can't see me doing that that's a problem it's sleeping where no time to give the shelves no time to do preparation that this just like so happy equals there and if we get time to go to the cantinas you just okay just something don't seem to be very many healthy options and if they're either you be gone by the time we get there \nT:\tthat's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid easy it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose it you will start losing the week because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet \nC:\tis there nothing you can do to help\nT:\tbut why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat? because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got k cubed I you for two weeks?\nC:\tyeah I think I should give it yeah if you \nT:\tif you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and where you now before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe set you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietitian to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight\nC:\tokay thank you  ",

Ferris and talk to him about that also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications and even over-the-counter things so check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new and lastly grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol Stan  so if you use grapefruit juice every day I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication just so I know we're on the same page can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?\nC:\tsure I'm just going to take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications and I guess I'll switch to orange juice and if I notice any muscle pain that is severe I'll call dr. Ferris right away \nT:\tgreat Kaylee I know we went over a lot today what other questions do you have for me \nC:\tI think you answered all my questions thank you fantastic \nT:\tall right well here's your prescription I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every at the same time every month and if you have any other questions later our phone numbers right here on the bottle and you can call me at any time thanks so much have a great day    \n",

I suppose you are taking too much Tylenol.\nC:\tTylenol?\nT:\tThere are Tylenol in the Percocet and you can reach a limit that actually damage your liver so there's some concerns there. Also the opiates that you are taking are above what we call the watchful though so that can actually increase your risk of dying relating to take an opioid that much overtime. \nC:\tut that’s all prescribed by my doctor, I’m sure he would know that. I’m above this watchful dose, I’m taking too much Tylenol. It should be fine. What’s the issue with having too much Opioid, I take what I need.\nT:\twell he should know, but he’s new, so maybe he doesn’t know. Anyways he send you to us and we are really the experts in the area, so we can make all these recommendations and he can work with you to carry this out. So first of all we are gonna take down your dose of Oxycodone. Second of all, we need to relook at the medications you are on firstly. All these different medications interrupt with each other.\nC:\tWhat do you mean sleep medication? I’m here just for the pain assessment.\nT:\tSo it’s just all this medication tie together. You don’t have to worry about anything, we are gonna be making recommendations to take care of everything. But to be honest, I can even believe that you are still awake while you are here. Like this is probably snowing you while you don’t realize. Did you drive here? \nC:\tI took the TTC but like I made it on to the TCC and I’m talking to you and I’m clearly not snowed. My sleeping medication is what I need to sleep. This is the pain assessment you are doing? I just don’t know why you are touching my sleeping meds.

  "﻿T:\tDiscuss a little bit of your medical history in your taking your vitals. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The rise in your blood pressure is concerning me, so I would like to gather a bit more information about your life style. \nC:\tk.\nT:\tHave you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?\nC:\tNot really, I haven’t been stressed, and I have a steady job. You know these day I’m really glad I have a job, I’m really happy that I’m working.\nT:\tI would also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure. Do you smoke at all?\nC:\tNo I don’t smoke. I smoke as a young adult, quit  year ago, I went cold turkey, proud of that, haven’t really thought about smoking.\nT:\tDo you drink alcohol and including beer or wine\nC:\tI do drink beer, I drink  or  times on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe  or  Cancel me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. \nT:\tI'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently it sounds like you're having about  to  drinks per week. It’s definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. \nC:\tWell my pressure has been high for years, \nT:\tWell according to your chart your blood pressure has gone up since July and you said that you've been drinking more recently so do you see the connection there. \nC:\tMaybe a little bit\nT:\talcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body so long with contributing to high blood pressure can have a big impact on your liver would you need to keep in mind so your liver has several different roles in your body for acid helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body and also helps process Alcohol and Other Drugs so when you have an excess of alcohol your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up an overtime your liver won't be able to work as well. \nT:\tHow about the use of other drugs like cocaine, hyrewen, marijuana? \nC:\tI don’t use marijuana cocaine, and I’ve never thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school,  years ago or so, I smoked weed, once I got out of school, I haven’t used that at all\nT:\tHave you ever used any prescription medications they weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?  \nC:\tNo I don’t really like the idea of taking pills, as a matter of fact, a couple years ago, I had this jaw surgery, they give me the prescription of … I took one, maybe felt wired, they still sit in the medicine cabin. \nT:\tOk, it sounds to me that the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health. \nC:\tI guess I’ll try. \nT:\tAnd then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now will recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this.

  "﻿T:\tokay so I'm just going to ask you a couple more background questions do you use any tobacco products or smoke cigarettes \nC:\tno I would bum cigarettes in college but I was never a smoker \nT:\tokay how about in the last year \nC:\tno not really anything \nT:\tokay and how often do you have a drink containing alcohol \nC:\ta few times a week Wednesday's I'll go to a happy hour and have about two or three and then um Thursday's seven seven or eight Friday's probably just a couple glasses of wine with dinner but Saturday's are a bigger night and I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar and then have  or  at when when I was out so \nT:\tokay so it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day so maybe around  drinks a week \nC:\tI guess it sounds like a lot when you say look at but yeah \nT:\tokay do you use any street drugs like any marijuana cocaine heroin\nC:\tno I I spoke weed in college but just a little bit I wasn't a regular smoker \nT:\tdo you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you or ever use your own prescriptions in a way in which they were not prescribed \nT:\tokay so you know as we said before you're drinking it sounds like you're drinking about  drinks a week over the course of a few days and I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day so you're doing more than that right now and when you drink more than this amount it puts you at risk for a number of things \nC:\tokay \nT:\tthings like greater risk of injury damage to different parts of your body just a bunch of different problems and so I'm going to recommend that you cut down to cut down that amount to the recommended limit again that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than  in a given day do you think you could do that would that be a good goal for you \nC:\tthat's a lot to change I don't know \nT:\tyeah I know that making changes isn't always easy but when you more than what's recommended it creates problems you know you said you hurt your ankle and came out of the bar this time\nC:\tI mean the stairs were really steep so yeah \nT:\twell it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol you know it can actually affect your balance and stability so really you know for where you are right now you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended and you know I want you to be healthy and I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else so I'm really going to recommend that you try to cut down to that amount so do you think you could do that cut down to no more than three drinks in a given day\nC:\twhere are these limits from an older population because I drink just as much as my friends do I mean everybody drinks like I drank I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group so I'm pretty middle of the road \nT:\tso it sounds like you know the amount you drink is pretty normal amongst the people you typically drink with but these limits are they're actually recommended for all adults and studies have shown that when you drink more than this it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about so you know why do you think you drink the amount you drink \nC:\tI don't know that's what we do is this is how we have fun I guess it is fun\nT:\twell I think it can still have fun with in these amounts so that's what I'm going to recommend I think this is a really good goal and hopefully we won't see any more injuries\nT:\tokay so why don't you try that \nC:\tokay \nT:\tall right thank you so much  ",

  "﻿T:\tHi Liz will thanks for meeting with me today so what's something that you'd like to change or work towards  C; well, I’ve really been thinking about working out lately, I really want to start working out again, It’s been on my mind, and I know I need to do it. It’s just getting the motivation to do it. \nT:\tand you’ve been talking about that a lot lately, So I really feel like this is something you need to do soon, because a lot of time there’s just a lot of talk, but there’s no action. And if you really want to see results, I guess it’s something that needs to be done and stop being lazy about it and just do it. \nC:\tWell I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it I think it's just that I have a busy schedule yeah I just need to find the time to do it and yes I might be laughing a little bit of motivation but I think it's more time again trying to fit it in. \nT:\tand it sounds like a lot of excuses to me, and you have shared with me before that you do have a gym membership so that’s just something you need to fit in your schedule. So for you to see results you want, my guess is that you need to go about  to  times a week and really fit in that hour workout on a daily basis. \nC:\tBut it is part of the problem is that I don't have  to  times a week to do it or an hour or even I mean hours the long time cuz if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there time there time back I mean it's not just an hour it's the two hours realistically and. \nT:\tand it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in and if it’s gonna take you two hours it’s gonna take you two hours. And again, if you want the results you need to start and you need to start now. \nC:\twell, Okay..\nT:\tI;m looking forward you see you tomorrow, and I'm hoping that you are going to be able to tell me that you went to the gym.

  "﻿T:\tfinish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news\nC:\tthat's great\nT:\thowever I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on \nC:\tI don't smoke cigarettes\nT:\tokay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it \nC:\twell the only thing I've never smoked cigarettes ever but when when I go out with my friends we like to go to you know we'd like to go out to lounges and and you know sometimes there are those those nice young men that gift you different sorts of things and we got some of those mini cigars that swisher Sweets they come on peach and and grape and and you know that's the only time that really you know I've ever really used anything that that's got to pack Oh in it okay \nT:\tso I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that I'm \nC:\treally bad but they're just little mini little cute little girly cigars\nT:\tright there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes \nC:\tboy only if it were just to relax I mean it's not like it's something that I would smoke  or  cigarettes a day I mean I only do it when we go out uh-huh\nT:\twell that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting \nC:\twell I didn't really know I'd started \nT:\twhat do you mean \nC:\tI didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars \nT:\tso you're going to quit then oh\nC:\tmaybe\nT:\twhat do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit\nC:\twell it's something that I'll have to think about \nT:\twhat's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in\nC:\twell it's just something that I do to relax and I don't with that often and so I probably could cut back \nT:\tokay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger \nC:\twell I don't believe that their cigars and what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right and it's something that I choose to do and so I will think about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real \nT:\tyou're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze who got any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die \nC:\twell it's something that I'll think about \nT:\twell I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change  ",
  "﻿T:\tso there anything else we can help you with today Jeff before we go \nC:\tno that's all of it \nT:\tgreat what I'd like to do just before you go is your recall in your reception the receptionist gave you a questionnaire to fill in \nC:\tyeah \nT:\tI just like to talk to you about their she enters it in the computer and I see from the way you filled it in we at the moment from a perspective of your health will classify your physical activity is inactive \nC:\twhat \nT:\tinactive so at the moment I'm like we're going to \nC:\thave a very busy life \nT:\tperhaps what I could tell you is looked at the moment the current recommendation for health is that everybody should do  minutes of moderate exercise at least five days that the week that's to benefit their head I fleets you mean now everybody\nC:\twhy why would I want to do that much \nT:\twhat's really important is particularly as somebody your age is you're really entering that age where we really need to think about heart disease diabetes\nC:\tit's nothing wrong with my health and\nT:\tthat's that's how we'd like to keep it of course and if you were to exercise at that level what we know is you half your risk of getting heart disease having high blood pressure getting diabetes gaining weight etc and of course my concern is that you're healthy at the moment we keep you there \nC:\tso what are you telling me but \nT:\twhat we really need to discuss is how we can get you to be a bit more physically active start moving this along a little bit \nC:\tI have a very busy life \nT:\tso you do a lot of things but from where you feel this in you really don't do enough physical activity to benefit your help or \nC:\tgive me for disagreeing with you but when you run a business but I do I mean I've got  i got  people in my company what you're saying it do you think it's easy running a company is it buddy chica thing you got telling me I'll growth when am I supposed to take time to get that don't want to go the gym edge imagine how running your cum I'm not aware the factory all day long you think that's not exercise I'm not sitting at a desk like you I'm sure you're all I Gobert all right I just like night \nT:\tI understand that you're on the go all the time but what's really important is no more that you protect your health now imagine running your business if you're held in the dark deteriorate \nC:\tthere's nothing wrong with my health \nT:\tand that's the way we'd like to keep it of course and what I'm really concerned about is all men of your age of my age is our health now is at a point where it starts to you know we have to think about heart disease and things like diabetes and one really good way of protecting ourselves this is to be physically active well we'll go around in circles it because i would say i am particularly active well\nC:\twhat are you telling me i should do that i don't do \nT:\twell if you think about that recommendation that any equivalent if you like of walk in two to three miles an hour a day at a fairly fast pace there are things equivalent to that not just being on the go that's you know marching rather than strolling mm-hmm\nC:\tand when would you like me to do this i mean i'm at work six thirty in the morning often don't go home till eight o'clock at night \nT:\twell ideally this is something to do every day this is kind of a minimum amount of physical activity\nC:\tthere can't be done \nT:\twell one of the things i should tell you about is that not doing this so not doing much physical activity does really increase this one of the most important risk factors for heart disease for some cancers colon cancer that affects many men and for elevated blood pressure all the things that we see are getting common in men as they get older start to become more risky if we avoid physical activity \nC:\tyeah are you just trying to scare me now aren't you I'm not equate I don't need I don't need all this \nT:\tso it's a genuine concern and obviously part of my job is to let you know about my concern and make sure you've got the right information to make decisions about your health and this is one of the important things you can't \nC:\tokay well I've got time to go walking every day so what's the next best thing I can do \nT:\twell the good news is you don't have to do it all in one gut you can do  minutes in the morn in  minutes at lunch time and ten minutes of an evening that would still lead to important health benefits I see anything in the bigger scheme of things is  minutes investment in your health worth it \nC:\twell people don't like that well of course is I don't to get sick but I die I just don't think it's necessary but I'm perfectly healthy so what why do you think it's so important\nT:\toh because the evidence tells us it really is an important risk factor similar in the way that smoking is we know now obviously everyone takes it as a bit of given that smoking's not really a good thing to do for their health and we're realizing that physical activity is the same avoiding physical activity is as much of a risk to your health as smoking is  C;\twell well what else could I do \nT:\twell I'd like you to really give some thought to doing a good brisk walk in the mornings every day and again in the evenings and you turn me walking around the factory is not enough \nT:\twell I suspect I don't know of course but I suspect it's not really the equivalent of a good March for ten continuum minutes \nC:\tcan I ask you a personal question well you say you know we're men of a simulator much exercise do you get \nT:\twell I try like you I've got a busy job and we're always on call etc but i do really try and fit in a good strong walk every day does that mean you do it every day most days most days I do\nC:\twell if you could do I suppose I could do it \nT:\tI think I do really think it's very important for you \nC:\tyou think it would make a big difference \nT:\tI think you'd be surprised how much difference it made and indeed when you're at work I suspect you know it'll help with the energy you have for that busy job and in the long term it yeah one way to think about it it's a real investment in the future \nC:\tI'm not convinced \nT:\tJeff family Jeff \nC:\tyes I have family \nT:\tso you can imagine at some point in the future you know you don't want to be in a situation where you you know want to play with the grandchildren for example and you can't because you simply unfit \nC:\tyeah well my grandchildren live overseas and actually so I don't get to see the left mmm \nT:\tbut you see my point \nC:\tgoodbye I'm not stupid\nT:\tyou don't want your lack of fitness no I mean how you behind on you know of course that I supply golf but I doubt the time these days mm-hmm take \nT:\tyou have been fitter \nC:\twhat I was younger yeah yeah\nT:\tso you think that's something you could do again \nC:\tno yeah because you know it says it is a popular pastime and it of course unless rubbish at it and I've got walking is a different matter I want what more bye dad is he really true walking did make a difference \nT:\tyes if you do it briskly mm-hmm this is \nC:\tI do everything bristly \nT:\tyeah well walk walking briskly does lead to very substantial health benefits yeah and\nC:\twell I'll try it I'm going to \nT:\twhen do you think you will do something\nC:\twhen I because these things you can imagine you're easy to agree to and then we meet again in a few weeks time and \nC:\ti'll tell you what i'll do then ok you've been straight with me I'll be straight with you instead of driving to work i'll walk to work that will take me  minutes that'd be fantastic that's right well I'll get my chauffeur to take me home \nT:\tok so deal then mm-hmm when we should start doing that geez \nC:\tI could do it tomorrow ok so deal with \nT:\tthen you're going to do  minutes of brisk walking today give it a try \nC:\tyeah if it does it up and I'm feeling different after a month I won't bother anymore because it be frank it's an inconvenience but i'll do it for you \nT:\twhy don't you and I meet again in a month mmm take stop and you can tell me what you found out yeah and then we'll have another chat about it then ok all right we'll do that ok alright fair enough thanks Jeff see you again in a month  ",

Soo\nC:\tI've heard it all but I just want to get my teeth fixed.\nT:\tYes and I really want to be helpful. I really want you to know my commitment is to your oral health so umm there are lots of medications out there, David that actually take away alot of the cravings there they make things soo much easier.\nC:\tI did a pill thing so I did try it.I did try it. I did the pill thing and they didn't work.\nT:\tmmm\nC:\tIt was a waste and it uh caused more side effects.\nT:\tNo it but David. David it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about  tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting.\nC:\tOr seven lectures along the road.\nT:\tAh well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture.\nC:\tWell\nT:\tThat's certainly not what I meant.I\nC:\tNaw I just feel that way.I get really, I get very defensive about when I get it from my family doc my cardiologist, everybody.

  "C:\tMm-hmm, yeah, I, I definitely don't want to come back here but, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms but the...\nT:\tYeah.\nC:\t... ridiculous part is I've had him for twelve years before and now it's a problem.\nT:\tWell you sound a bit surprised by that but I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma and pets are a really big source of problems, in that respect.\nC:\tYeah bu-, I, um, let me just clarify.  I've seen the materials, I have them...\nT:\tMm-hmm.\nC:\t...I haven't read them.  All I've been doing is taking the medicine so I don't know that much about this.\nT:\tWell, w-, wait a second, Sal.  What do you mean yo-, yo-, ha-, if you, as an, you know, to be informed about I'm just re-, really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby?\nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tA new baby?\nC:\tGian-Carlo, yeah.\nT:\tAnd you are very concerned about your health.  You want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've, you've almost quit smoking...\nC:\tMm-hmm.\nT:\t...which is fantastic. So the next step is to really d-, deal with the dog, deal with the pet.  I know it's, it's going to be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals.  I'm sure that you have friends or family members.\nC:\tUh...this is a little too much right now.  First of all Gian-Carlo is taken care of, that's fine.  He doesn't have no asthma from the dog.  It's just me, I don't have...\nT:\tIt's you that I'm worried about, Sal.\nC:\tAh\nT:\tIt's you that I'm worried about.  OK.  Th-, the symptoms are worse.  You've had two or three major asthma attacks and I, do you appreciate how this is a-, a-, a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms.  It, it truly is something to take very very seriously.  I can't emphasize that enough.\nC:\tSo Oscar's going to make me die.  He hasn't made me die in twelve years and the doctor saying, \"oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking,\" so what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die?  I've had him for twelve years.\nT:\tSal, wh-, ah, do, you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse.  You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone.  You know this.\nC:\tWell they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one and I'll keep Oscar.\nT:\tSal, you're almost on the strongest one.  And if Oscar's that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby?  Than your wife?  Like, ah, that makes no sense to me.  Do you understand how important this is?\nC:\tI understand that I don't think you get my situation.  I've had this dog for twelve years so I'm not just going to up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing.\nT:\t[Sighs]\nC:\tHo-...\nT:\tOK. ",
  "C:\tYeah.\nT:\tGreat, how are you doing today?\nC:\tOh, pretty good, always busy this time of year but keeping up. How are you?\nT:\tDoing great.\nT:\tAlright, your blood pressure is  over \nC:\tThat's good right?\nT:\tYes.\nC:\tGood, I've always been healthy\nT:\tWell, not always. It looks like you got a letter about your AC and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes.\nC:\tMy what?\nT:\tYour AC. It measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months do determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar.\nC:\tOh yeah, I got that letter but I didn't really know what it meant and I never really paid attention to my diabetes because I feel fine, how bad is it?\nT:\tWell let's see. today it was . and three months ago, it was .. So normal is less than , you're way out of control.\nC:\tWell, like I've said, I've been way busy this month.\nT:\tWell your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?\nC:\tNot really, I rather use diet and exercise.\nT:\tWell it looks like that's not really adequate, so you need to be taking your medications. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough. Your chart says that you've been prescribed Metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think it will be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?\nC:\tUm, Yeah sometimes.\nT:\tOk, how often?\nC:\tOh, once every few weeks but I feel fine so I don't think it's that bad.\nT:\tWell remember, your AC was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel. So um, it showed that you were out of control. If you don't start making changes, you can permanently damage your eyesight, blood vessels, even have to have a front leg amputated\nC:\tOh, well I'll definitely do something before it got that bad, but I'm not interested in taking those medications. I'll try to eat better or do something\nT:\tI don't think you realize how serious your disease is.\nC:\tI don't see how I can be sick if I feel fine. I don't want to take medications.\nT:\t*Sigh* Just because you feel fine doesn't mean that you're healthy. Having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big ulcer on their foot.\nC:\tWell, I remember my doctor telling me something about the symptoms of high blood sugar like feeling shaky or tired, but I never felt shaky or tired.\nT:\tWell, those are some symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms. That's the whole reason for doing an AC, to determine if your blood sugar is out of control, and your AC showed that your blood sugar has been out of control.\nC:\tI get what you're saying, but I feel fine and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel any better. I mean, what if it makes me worse? When my grandfather was on heart medications, the levels got so high that he almost got a heart attack.\nT:\tHeart medications and diabetic medications are very different. You can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication, they're completely different. Will you at least try taking your medications?\nC:\tI don't know, I will think about it.\nT:\tAlright, well we'll see you in a few months then. ",
  "C:\tIt calms my nerves. It makes me feel good.\nT:\tIt calms your nerves and makes you feel good.\nC:\tI can't go without it.\nT:\tOK Ms. Fisher listen to this, by continuing to smoke you are putting your body in a great amount of harm COPD, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, all these other type of bad things. You know so why haven't you quit yet?\nC:\tBecause it's hard and I like it.\nT:\tI don't understand. What's so tough about it? Can't you understand that you are putting your body at great harm by continuing to smoke?\nC:\tI mean I guess so.\nT:\tYou guess so. OK so good. So that means you want to quit now right?\nC:\tYeah\nT:\tOK, good, good I'm glad to hear you say that. So this is what were gonna do. First, were gonna set a quit date. Next, I want you to go home and remove all the cigarettes in your surroundings. Like, as soon as you leave here. And then finally, I'm gonna give you this prescription for Chantix which you can take every day, and also these nicotine patches. Ok.\nC:\tYeah\nT:\tOk, alright good. We'll set an appointment for you to come see me in another month. When we see you in another month you need to have quit smoking cigarettes because you know how bad it is for you. Alright? Alright, you can pick up the prescription from my nurse on your way out and then call me at the clinic if you have any questions. OK. Thank you so much it was good seeing you again. OK, Alright. Take care. Bye ",
  "C:\tThat's great.\nT:\tHowever, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here... the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so...\nC:\tI don't...\nT:\tI'm just wondering what's going on.\nC:\tI don't smoke cigarettes.\nT:\tOK. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation. In particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really deathly white colored, and there's little red spots, and you probably didn't notice cause we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth. But you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called, Nicotinex Domotitus, and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes. Are you smoking a pipe? Or cigars? Or, is there something else that..\nC:\tWell...\nT:\tCould be contributing to this, because I don't know what else might be causing it.\nC:\tWell, no. Only thing... I've never smoked cigarettes, ever.\nT:\tMmm hmm.\nC:\tUm, but, um, when um, when I got with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges...\nT:\tMmm hmm.\nC:\tAnd, um, you know, sometimes there are those... those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things, and we got some of those many, uh, cigars, that Swisher Sweets...\nT:\tUh huh.\nC:\tThey come in peach, and grape, and... and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that, that's got tobacco in it.\nT:\tOK. So, I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit flavored, people think they're OK. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?\nC:\tReally bad, but they're just little, mini little, cute little, girly cigars.\nT:\tRight. They're still cigars. And they're still tobacco. And so, they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema. All those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes.\nC:\tWell, I only use 'em...\nT:\tThis is really important.\nC:\tJust to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke twenty or thirty cigarettes a day. I mean, I only do it when we go out.\nT:\tUh huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that. So, that's good. But it's still causing a lot of problems, and as I said, I can see the... the evidence in the roof of your mouth. You're causing some serious damage. And this needs to stop.  Have you thought about quitting?\nC:\tWell, I didn't really know I'd started.\nT:\tWhat do you mean?\nC:\tI didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking. Just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.\nT:\tSo, you're gonna quit then?\nC:\tUhh, maybe.\nT:\tWhat do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth. You're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.\nC:\tWell, it's something that I'll have to think about.\nT:\tWhat's there to think about? You said it's not, that... something you do all that often. Um, there's all these negative side effects. There's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.\nC:\tWell,it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so, I probably could cut back.\nT:\tOK, well that's a good start, but cutting back isn't gonna do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from... from being at risk for these other diseases. But, but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars, you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.\nC:\tWell, I don't believe that they're cigars, and... what I do believe is that, it's a choice. And it's my right. And it's something that I choose to do. And so, I will think about cutting back. But I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that, and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.\nT:\tYou're choosing to really damage your mouth, and actually it can cause problems with your teeth, too. I don't know if you've noticed your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use. Whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chews, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making, and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick, and potentially die.\nC:\tWell, it's something that I'll think about.\nT:\tWell, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about, because it's something that really needs to change. ",
  "﻿T:\tCan I help you?\nC:\tUh yea, I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke free so I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they work very well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.\nT:\tSo you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking?\nC:\tMaybe like, during the day nicotine replacement. Is that, I mean do you have anything like that?\nT:\tYea, we don't really recommend that. The idea is that you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.\nC:\tWell I don't really want to quit, I mean I like smoking, I like going after work to have a beer with my friends, not smoke cigarettes. I mean, I know it's not really a big deal, cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean I know it's popular to say smoking is bad for you but ya know, I like it so I'm going to keep doing it.\nT:\tOkay well smoking really is really bad for you, you know it causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease.\nC:\tYeah. Okay.\nT:\tOral disease.\nC:\tOh well what are my options now? Assuming that I am right, what are my options?\nT:\tWell to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch, I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.\nC:\tI smoke barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoked about  or  years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes but it's sorta hard to get through the day at work.\nT:\tOkay well we actually consider  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.\nC:\tSounds good to me. The more nicotine the better. Is there like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. Do you have?\nT:\tWell there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, then probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something that you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.\nC:\tOh. Okay. Well where is that?\nT:\tWell, we have that here but again but the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.\nC:\tWell, I'm probably not going to buy anything today. I mean I just came by to see what my options are. Thanks for the input. Do you have anything else? Do you have any other?\nT:\tWell.\nC:\tAdvice for me?\nT:\tAside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you, again that's not something you wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.\nC:\tOh well. Okay, well, thanks, I mean I guess that helps a little bit. Maybe I'll be back later. Thanks. ",
  "C:\tYeah.\nT:\tThat's really a problem.\nC:\tYeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset.\nT:\tWell, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?\nC:\tYeah, I ...  Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him.\nT:\tWell, the fact that he's having these ear infections, is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke. And so, what can you tell me about that?\nC:\tI ...  I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car, um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just ...  I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it, so I try really hard.\nT:\tI really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden.  Do you know, smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections,  it could get to the point where he'll have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also things like vitamins C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In additions to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?\nC:\tNo. But I don't smoke ...  I ...  I ...  I've thought about quitting, but it's just, it's really hard. So, I just don't know how to do it.\nT:\tWell, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for Emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease. For all kinds of things.\nC:\tI know, I know. I've heard people tell me before. I've heard all that. I just  ...  don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's so hard.\nT:\tWell, there's all kinds of things you can use know. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum. There's the inhaler. There's  nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban. There's quit smoking groups  you can go to. There's hotlines you can call ...\nC:\tI just don't have time for any of that ...\nT:\tThere's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit. This is really important.\nC:\tI understand that. I know it is ...  I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really, it's really really hard.\nT:\tWell, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?\nC:\tI don't know.\nT:\tI really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.\nC:\tI'll, I'll, I'll go look at all those things and I'll find ...  I guess I'll try to find something, and I'll talk to my doctor about it.\nT:\tOK, well I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.\nC:\tOK. Whatever. OK.\nT:\tOK ",

You keep that number.  Don't worry about your family okay.\nC:\tWell Miss, I don't understand.  In class you said that when something important happens then you must tell your family. You know how bad this is.\nT:\tWhat, what are you saying? Are you trying to say that I'm wrong?  Uh, heh, don't, don't do that.  Don't do that. I'm not wrong gir. I know what I'm doing. You just, you find that number and, and, and they will, they will help you. Don't you question what I'm doing.  Alright. Okay.  You find that number.\nC:\tOf course I'm not.\nT:\tAll the best. All the best. Okay. That's it.  That's it. There you go. ",
  "C:\tNo, not really.\nT:\tWhy, what happened?\nC:\tWell, since I had a relapse back in the spring, I've noticed I've had a lot more trouble with my walking, and a lot of problems with my memory. And I'm just tired all the time.\nT:\tWell how long ago did this all begin?\nC:\tAfter that relapse about two or three months ago.\nT:\tWell have you been taking your Rubiff reguarly?\nC:\tNo, not really. I don't feel like it's helping much.\nT:\tWell when did you stop taking it?\nC:\tWell, first I started by just stretching it out. I was only taking it every three to four days, and then I totally stopped at about a month ago.\nT:\tSo your symptoms may be because you stopped your drug?\nC:\tI don't think so. I didn't stop taking it until after my walking started to go. After that I did everything you told me to do. I took my shots religiously, a lot of help it's been.\nT:\tI think you should go back on the drug. We know from clinical trial that it helps to slow progression. Going off it is only going to make things worse.\nC:\tI don't know if I believe that. I mean if it does, it hasn't helped me.\nT:\tWell, the data's clear! I think the first thing we need to do is get you back on the drug. We also need to change the way you're thinking about your MS and the drug. Drug's not a cure. It's only gonna slow progression. You know if you weren't on this drug, your symptoms would've come back sooner. And you need to think of the last two years that you've had without major symptoms as a success.\nC:\tWell, that's hard to do when you feel like I do.\nT:\tI know, I see this all the time with my patients.\nC:\tSo is this normal?\nT:\tI wouldn't say \"normal\". MS is different for everyone.\nC:\tSo what about me?\nT:\tWell that's hard to say. So I'll see you in three months and you can start going back on the drug. Any questions?\nC:\tNo ",
  "T:\tGood afternoon, this is April from the pharmacy, could I speak to Faith please?\nC:\tThis is faith.\nT:\tI see you haven't picked up your prescription this month. Are you having some problems with it?\nC:\tAre you talking about my Avenex?\nT:\tYeah.\nC:\tWell, I haven't been taking it for the last couple of weeks. To be honest, I took it for a year because my neurologist told me I should, but lately I haven't seen any reason to continue doing it because I don't feel better and I don't think I'm doing that badly.\nT:\tWho' your doctor?\nC:\tDr. Livingston. He' my neurologist. I think I remember him saying something about it slowly the progression, but frankly April, I don't know what that means. He doesn't explain things very well, and if I ask him, he doesn't take the time to answer my questions.\nT:\tHave you had any symptoms lately?\nC:\tNo, not really.\nT:\tDo you have any problems taking the drug?\nC:\tI'm not crazy about taking the shots, but that's not the issue.\nT:\tAre you having problems paying for it because we can help you with that.\nC:\tNo, my HMO covers it.\nT:\tI'm not sure I understand what the problem is.\nC:\tWell, like I said, I don't see the point of taking this drug. What's it doing for me?\nT:\tAs it says in the patient education kit you received, it reduces the risk of a second attack by over forty percent. The clinical data is very strong.\nC:\tWell, now you're sounding just like my neurologist. I still don't understand what that means.\nT:\tWell, Avonex provides a thirty seven percent reduction in risk of progression to sustain disability in two years and a forty-four reduction in risk of developing a second relapse in up-to three years.\nC:\tOkay?\nT:\tAre you interested in reordering your prescription?\nC:\tNo, not really, I, I think I want to think about this for a while.\nT:\tIt's important that you stay on it. There aren't really many options for MS.\nC:\tWell, maybe we have to wait until something better comes along.\nT:\tMy expert opinion is that you stay on the medication until it does. Until newer drugs are developed this is the bet e have.\nC:\tWell that's depressing.\nT:\tWell, only if you think about it that way.\nC:\tYeah, okay. So are we done?\nT:\tUnless there's anything else I can do to help.\nC:\tNo, thank, bye.\nT:\tOkay, bye bye. ",
  "C:\tRight.\nT:\tAnd now she's coughing. Um.\nC:\tYes\nT:\tSounds like post-nasal drip. I think it's probably just a virus.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tUm, and I don't think she needs antibiotics, it's not going to do anything.\nC:\tGood, okay.\nT:\tBut uh, and she'll probably be better by the weekend.\nC:\tGood.\nT:\tUm, before we finish up today I think we really need to talk about Ganesa weight.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tUm, according to the chart she is has a BMI of  which is at the  percentile, which is considerably overweight and we need to think about getting her weight down. Um, does she eat healthy does she, is she pretty active?\nC:\tOkay, well, I don't know anything about this, um, BMI or  percentile, but I mean, she's a big boned girl. All of the girls in our family are. I mean she's active, she's growing. She looks healthy to me.\nT:\tWell, I think we need to check her cholesterol and her triglycerides. Cus, um, at this BMI, they, um, there might be some problems already, some serious problems, and if we look at these labs now, you know maybe you'll start to see that this is a serious problem.\nC:\tOkay, I don't know about all that, but I just brought her in here for a cough. Plus, you know, Ganesa hates needles and she was proud that there was no needles today.\nT:\tWell, I guess the blood work can wait, but we're going to have to get it done within the next year. Let's talk about her exercise, does she get enough aerobic exercise?\nC:\tWell, yeah, at school and on weekends, she sometimes plays with her friends, but she's very active, she, she's strong.\nT:\tOkay, okay, well what about her diet. Does she eat a lot of junk food or drink soda?\nC:\tWell, we eat together a lot. And I mean, we only go to the fast food restaurant a few times a week. And she always drinks lemonade, never soda.\nT:\tOkay, well, um, you're going to have to cut the fast food down to no more than once a week. And lemonade, it's as bad as soda, it's full of sugar, so you're going to have to get her to drink more water.\nC:\tWell, with the, the stress on my job, and, and, working long hours, I mean, sometimes we only get to eat fast food. And, and, she won't drink water.\nT:\tOh, Okay, well, do what you can. And tell me about her T.V. Does she watch a lot of T.V.?\nC:\tWell I mean a few hours after school. I mean, more than what I would like. I mean, I try, but no kids don't listen.\nT:\tOkay, well, the American Academy Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours a day, so I think we're going to have to get that down to below two hours.\nC:\tWell, that's going to be very difficult because, I, I need that time so that I can catch up on.\nT:\tOkay,\nC:\tUm\nT:\twell, listen um, we're going to need to finish up here. I'd really like to see Ganesa lose three to five pounds before we see her again. So, let me just kinda go over what we talked about. More water, less junk food, less fast food and uh, cut down on the TV. Does that sound okay?\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tOkay, Thanks for coming in.\nC:\tThanks ",
  "C:\tHi.\nT:\tHow are you?\nC:\tYeah, I've been sitting here saying that word.\nT:\tWell, I don't know last time I called you and then the phone is not ringing and I'm not sure.  I'm glad you called.\nC:\tYup.\nT:\tAnd set up an appointment with me.\nC:\tYup, for the last three days, we've had storms and it's been cloudy and I have not had no signal on this phone until today.\nT:\tWow.\nC:\tBecause I had four or five people have called me.\nT:\tReally?\nC:\tYeah, and I just didn't get it.\nT:\tWell, before we begin I just want to remind you that all calls at Aetna is subject to be monitored and recorded for the quality assurance, okay.\nC:\tYup, yes ma'am.\nT:\tAnd then also about genetic information non discrimination act just a reminder too that because of legislation prohibits gathering genetic information so when you answer my question you don't have to include any family medical history or any information related to genetics, okay?\nC:\tUh-huh.\nT:\tSo how you been since I spoke to you last time?\nC:\tOh, I've been fine.  I've been to the doctor; I went for my six months checkup.\nT:\tOkay, when was that?\nC:\trd of June.\nT:\tOkay, what the doctor say?\nC:\tThat everything looked good, they took my blood and I haven't heard a thing from them.  Most times they usually send me something if something is wrong.\nT:\tUsually, yeah, if you don't hear from the doctor that means good news isn't it?\nC:\tYeah, yeah.\nT:\tBecause if something's wrong most definitely they will call you.\nC:\tUh-huh, yup, my six month checkup.\nT:\tSo you do all the cholesterol check and everything?\nC:\tI don't do nothing.\nT:\tI mean the doctor draws your blood work.\nC:\tYeah, yeah, they drew all the blood, I think they draw two vials of blood.  He said that they would notify me within about three or four days, but I never have, they usually send a piece of paper stating that everything was okay, but I didn't get nothing this time, figured it was okay.\nT:\tWell, I just want to ask you a question this time.  I want to ask you about the tobacco that you've been using, so what kind of tobacco product you use?\nC:\tThis is a loose leaf.\nT:\tOkay, like a chewing tobacco?\nC:\tYes, ma'am.\nT:\tSo you used the last four weeks?\nC:\tI what?\nT:\tYou have been using the last four weeks?\nC:\tYeah, I've been using tobacco for the last four weeks.  Sixty years I've been doing that.\nT:\tSixty years, have you been to the dentist to have them check your mouth?\nC:\tI've got dentures.  I've had dentures ever since I was about  years old.\nT:\tDo you see a dentist?\nC:\tNo, I don't go to a dentist.\nT:\tSo you have not seen a dentist for how many years?\nC:\tOh, shucks, I ain't seen a dentist since I had my teeth pulled out, I reckon.  That's probably - years ago.\nT:\tYou're kidding me, really,  to  years ago, oh my gosh.  You're probably the only person I know that don't see the dentist.\nC:\tIf you've got dentures, what's the use of going to the dentist if you've got dentures?\nT:\tWell, usually dentists will check your mouth.  Sometimes if you chew tobacco you have a chance that there might have some growth or something abnormal in your mouth and you don't know, you see.\nC:\tWell, most of the time if I do, I usually tell, I can tell if something's maybe wrong with my mouth.  I usually take my dentures out and let them soak; I'll wash them up with warm salt water and stuff like that before I go to bed.\nT:\tSo you kind of take care of your mouth?\nC:\tWell sorta.  I think I've done pretty good.\nT:\tBut you only use the leaf tobacco; you're not smoking or anything.\nC:\tNo, I don't smoke; I never did take up the habit of smoking.\nT:\tBut, how often do you chew tobacco a day?\nC:\tAll the time.\nT:\tAll day long?\nC:\tAll the time, all day long, all day long, from the time I get up, time I go to bed.\nT:\tSo how much does that cost you?\nC:\tUm, this tobacco it probably cost me maybe $. a day.\nT:\tSo basically, you're not planning on cutting down; you are just going to do the same thing?\nC:\t___________if it starts to gets to bothering me, I'd probably cut down.\nT:\tOkay.\nC:\tSo far I have no problem.  I use to chew ______________ tobacco, back when they use to have ___________ tobacco, years ago, I use to, when I first started chewing I was chewing _____________.\nT:\tHave you ever used any type of medication or any nicotine to try to stop chewing tobacco?\nC:\tNo, ma'am.\nT:\tNo, okay.\nC:\tNo, ma'am.  I haven't found no reason to.\nT:\tAnd your doctor knows about it that you chew tobacco?\nC:\tYes, yes, he does.\nT:\tAnd you have not been checked with ultrasound or anything like that?  Have you ever had an abdominal aortic aneurysm test?  Probably not.\nC:\tNo, I don't think so.\nT:\tIf you not see a dentist, I bet you.\nC:\tNo, I hardly ever been to a doctor.  I don't go to no dentist.  I don't go unless something bothers me.  If I get sick or something, I'll go to a doctor, as long as I stay healthy and able to work and get out here and go, I don't go see a doctor.  My wife, I tell you she goes sometimes two or three times a month.\nT:\tDid your wife use any tobacco products?\nC:\tShe smokes.\nT:\tShe use to smoke, okay.\nC:\tShe smokes, smokes like a freight train.\nT:\tWell, you know, a lot of time just like, what's his name Georg Burns, I think he smoke or something all his life right, and, but even though she smoked you didn't want to smoke you just only want to chew?\nC:\tWell, yes.  I worked in the cigarette factory for  years?\nT:\tOh, you did.\nC:\tYeah, making cigarettes and I never did really take up the habit of smoking.  Yeah, all I done was chew tobacco.\nT:\tFor  years, okay.\nC:\tYeah, well  years.\nT:\tyears.\nC:\tThe Reynolds Tobacco Company and I really didn't want to go to work then, but my wife made me.\nT:\tWell, your wife make you, how did she make you?\nC:\tWell, see I was working for myself and I was , about  years old when I work to work and I was doing some work for a guy and he was one of the big wheels at and he just asked me one day if I wanted to work and I told him no.  I was an outside person, I didn't want to work in a factory and I told my wife, and she said your crazy, she said you better go to work and get them benefits and insurance and all that, so I waited about two months and I went down and they hired me before I went out the door.\nT:\tWell, it is my job that I have to inform you about the risk of smoking or not smoking but chew tobacco the risk is to get a sore or ulcer in your mouth you may not know because sometimes it might start in some area that you cannot feel, okay.  So, but when in doubt you do see the doctor you can always go to that doctor that check your lab and have them see just to be sure whenever something happen, okay.\nC:\tYeah, whenever something happens I'll go.\nT:\tYeah, and just to make sure that because you know why if early early detection is much better then when you do them late.\nC:\tI understand that.\nT:\tBecause when I use to work at cancer hospital and I know that have a cancer in the mouth it just not a pleasant thing.  It affects a lot of eating and things like that, you know, and if probably you have cancer in the lungs, right, you can eat, but cancer in the mouth, it's just very difficult.\nC:\tYup.\nT:\tI just want to let you know that at least check your mouth, if you don't want doctor check you can check it and then you can examine yourself, you know, do your, do your gargle and things like that to kind of keep, you know, keep, because I'm a nurse and I've seen it and I just think like oh, my gosh, you know, if you have something wrong in the mouth, it's probably the most devastating because we have to eat food and when you cannot food it makes it so difficult.\nC:\tWell, if I didn't have to eat I wouldn't have to try to lose weight.\nT:\tYou have a problem with weight gain?\nC:\tNot really, I usually stay about the same weight about all the time.  I'm somewhere around  to , somewhere along in there.  I gain more weight in the wintertime because I don't work as much.  I'm always sitting around and stuff like that, but in the summertime, I get out and work and sweat it all off and all that.  Most of the time, I usually lose a little bit of weight in the summertime.\nT:\tYeah, and you play golf.\nC:\tYes, I play golf, but I haven't had much of a golf season this year.  I've been a working too hard.\nT:\tWell, and another thing, you know, you can think about because right now you use them all the time, you know, sometime even though you quit just a little bit or something like that it could help too.  So think about that okay and then I sure appreciate you calling I always enjoy talking to you.  You always have something to tell me like, you know, how, a lot of times people don't think about taking something to kind of help with your acid and stuff like that, you have a lot of knowledge in some way, the old fashion way.\nC:\tWell, I guess that just comes from my family.\nT:\tFrom your family, did your family smoke?\nC:\tMy family history and stuff like that, I don't know, I think my family was __________ like that.  They never did really get much sickness and stuff like that.\nT:\tThey work hard.\nC:\tYeah and always worked hard and stuff.  I can usually tell when I feel bad, if I feel bad, I usually try to work on myself for a few days and if I don't get better I go to the doctor.\nT:\tYeah, in a lot of old days that's how people do it.\nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tYou know, you not depend on with a lot of medication like what we do now.\nC:\tYeah, I know it.  Back in the early 's people didn't go to the doctor hardley they used they're own remedies and stuff like that.\nT:\tA lot of old remedies back then, you know, that people do and people use.\nC:\tYeah, and I still use some of that.  I still drink my vinegar.\nT:\tYour garlic and all that stuff.\nC:\tYeah.\nT:\tAnd you take niacin.\nC:\tThat keeps me from going to a doctor.\nT:\tYeah, and I think, you know, just have to kind of make some sense about this okay and then I will call you next time.  I'd like to ask you a question about your diabetes.\nC:\tDiabetes, as far as I know, I reckon my diabetes is good.  I don't check it or nothing.\nT:\tOkay.  I have spoke to many people that they don't check too, it doesn't surprise me now when you say that.  But anyway, let me go ahead; look to see what day I can call you okay?\nC:\tHave you got the phone number to the house, the house phone?\nT:\tLet me take a look to see what we have.  Well, the number I dial now what is this number?\nC:\tThis is the cell phone.\nT:\tOkay, the cell let me look to see if I have ... .  Let me take a look at my record.\nC:\tI called today, this evening.\nT:\tYes.\nC:\tTo set up this appointment and I give the young lady the number for the house just in case ... .\nT:\tOkay, the number I have is.\nC:\tYeah, you can call the house number, if you can't get me on the cell phone.\nT:\tOkay, all right, I will do that.  Call the house that way I won't miss you.\nC:\tAll right, more likely you'll probably catch me on that.  So if you're having bad weather you won't catch me on the cell phone.\nT:\tThat's true and that's true.  Let me make an appointment to call you back on July .\nC:\tJuly .\nT:\tIt's Friday.\nC:\tOh, let's see, make it late.\nT:\tHow late?\nC:\tProbably around  or so.\nT:\tLike today?\nC:\tLike today, I'm more likely to be here.\nT:\tWell on the th I can't call you at, how about, let me take a look some other day.\nC:\tMy wife just mentioned that our son is coming in from the military and he'll be here that week.\nT:\tHow about on the th, Monday?\nC:\tMonday.\nT:\tOn the th yes.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tI can call you anytime you want me to.\nC:\tWell, you can call me probably; I don't reckon we'll be going off on a Monday, most of the time we might be gone on a Friday or a Saturday.\nT:\tSo th would be good on Monday?\nC:\tth would be probably be better.\nT:\tHow about like  your time?\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tokay?\nC:\tYeah, they usually call me and remind me to keep my appointment.\nT:\tYes.\nC:\tBut, you know, things could come up.\nT:\tWell, I will send a reminder call two days before our appointment, okay.  But since being on the weekend, th, let me see, you'll probably get the reminder call probably maybe on the th.\nC:\tOkay.\nT:\tOkay, on the th and then you do have my number.\nC:\tYes, ma'am.\nT:\tAnd I sure appreciate your time calling me so that way I get to talk to you and then, you know, I always enjoy talking to you.\nC:\tI enjoy talking to you.

I've been talking to you for so many months now.  Just like you read it, if you just read like, you know, kind of break it down into the three syllables.\nC:\tShe underlined it for me.\nT:\tWell, don't call me by a different name, I might not answer you.  I might not know my name, you know.  That's not my name.\nC:\tOh gee.\nT:\tWhat is your wife's name?  That's a beautiful name.\nT:\tSee I can call her she can call my name.\nC:\tYup, yup.
